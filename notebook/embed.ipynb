       "[\"Does entrepreneurship education in the first year of higher education develop entrepreneurial intentions? The role of learning and inspiration Drawing on entrepreneurship education (EE) theory, this article examines the role of learning and inspiration in developing students' entrepreneurial intentions in the First Year in Higher Education. This addresses the paucity of research on early university experiences of EE and their influence on entrepreneurial intentions. Using a longitudinal survey of business students at a British university, the authors identify four scenarios related to the participation/non-participation in EE and subsequent increase or decrease of entrepreneurial intentions. A sub-set of those surveyed are interviewed (n=49) to better understand how their university experience has influenced their entrepreneurial intentions. Findings suggest that the influence of EE is variable, in some cases even leading to a decrease in entrepreneurial intentions. The results contribute to theories of EE and intentions in the early stages of higher education. The authors discuss implications for theory and practice.\",\n",
       " \"Adapting to constructivist approaches to entrepreneurship education in the Chinese classroom Encouragement by the Chinese government for education to move from an emphasis on passive learning, rote memorisation and mechanical training towards the development and delivery of education using active, student-centred education approaches has resulted in tensions and challenges, one of which is the reaction of students previously used to traditional passive transmission learning. To study the challenges that Chinese students face when undertaking a constructivist experience-based entrepreneurship course focused on process rather than content, eight groups of business students at a Chinese university were tasked with developing projects which would add value to the university's international community. The qualitative research identified four key themes: a lack of familiarity with the constructivist learning process; group work and group dynamics; the linkage of taught content to practical activities; and the reflective process of learning in constructivist education. The findings and suggested remedies as to how these challenges can be minimised are discussed.\",\n",
       " \"Active entrepreneurship education and the impact on approaches to learning: Mixed methods evidence from a six-year study into one entrepreneurship educator's classroom Taking an active and experiential approach to teaching is often assumed to be the best way to promote learning. However, the empirical evidence to support this assertion in entrepreneurship education is inconclusive, and current practice suggests that delivery in higher education is still quite passive and traditional. This 6-year, mixed method study sets out to demonstrate that, in a final-year International Entrepreneurship module at a UK university mapped through the lens of 'about', 'for' and 'through' entrepreneurship, a more innovative, active, experiential and constructively aligned approach to teaching, learning and assessment impacts positively on students' deep and surface approaches to learning. Students viewed the module as significantly more active than passive and the level of deep learning was significantly greater than the level of surface learning. Additionally, the more active approach was significantly correlated to increased deep learning and reduced surface learning. Students highlighted the active teaching approach and the creation of videos for a local company as part of the authentic assessment as catalysts for deeper learning approaches. The study provides empirical evidence that active entrepreneurship education has a positive impact on student approaches to learning.\",\n",
       " 'Nurturing Entrepreneurial Spirit Through Integrative Learning Method: The Role of Entrepreneurial Inspiration and Mindset Having entrepreneurship in student education may promote social innovation and economic development by fostering job creation. Numerous colleges are now emphasizing entrepreneurship education; therefore, it is essential to identify a practical learning approach. This research explored how an integrative learning model can nurture student entrepreneurial intention through entrepreneurial inspiration and entrepreneurial mindset. Data were collected from 286 business undergraduate students in Indonesia using an online self-reported questionnaire and analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modelling. The results demonstrate that cognitive learning positively affects entrepreneurial inspiration (beta =.37, p <.001) and mindset (beta =.23, p =.01). Accordingly, experiential learning also positively affects entrepreneurial inspiration (beta =.19, p =.02) and mindsets (beta =.27, p <.001). Second, entrepreneurial inspiration positively affects entrepreneurial mindset (beta =.34, p <.001) and entrepreneurial intentions (beta =.16, p =.04). Third, entrepreneurial mindset positively affects entrepreneurial intentions (beta =.55, p <.001). The results also confirm the mediating role of entrepreneurial mindset between cognitive and experiential learning on intention (beta =.13, p =.008; beta =.06, p <.001, consecutively) and also the mediating role of inspiration between cognitive and experiential learning on mindset (beta =.06, p =.01; beta =.03, p =.03). The results show that it could be useful for universities to use an integrative learning approach that involves cognitive and experiential learning to encourage inspiration and shape entrepreneurial mindset of students.',\n",
       " 'Developing entrepreneurial behaviours in the Chinese classroom through value creation pedagogy Entrepreneurship education in higher education has been actively encouraged by the Chinese government. However, entrepreneurship education using active learning methods can be at odds with traditional Chinese educational practices. Value creation pedagogy has been posited as an innovative teaching method to bridge the gap between didactic and progressive pedagogy to support entrepreneurship education across a range of students. However, there is a paucity of research into the use of value creation pedagogy and the application of novel pedagogy in the Chinese context. This research explores the views of students at a Chinese university on the value and limitations of value creation pedagogy in supporting learning and developing entrepreneurial behaviours.',\n",
       " 'Entrepreneurship Education Pedagogical Approaches in Higher Education Entrepreneurship education, as an emerging scientific field, has undergone significant evolution at the conceptual and praxis levels. The concept of entrepreneurship was considered from a broad perspective as the capacity to act upon opportunities and ideas, thereby creating social, cultural, or financial value in diverse contexts. The study and cultivation of this competence are highly relevant to enhancing employability and equipping young people with the skills, knowledge, and attitudes necessary within an entrepreneurial culture for the exercise of active citizenship. This study aims to consolidate the concept and analyse the pedagogical approaches in entrepreneurship education, particularly focusing on experiential learning. It also explores the most frequently used instructional methods in higher education programmes. The research is based on a comprehensive literature review, complemented by a case study of the entrepreneurship education programme implemented at the University of Lisbon, in Portugal, enriched by data collected from one of its curricular units. Experiential learning emerges as a valid approach in entrepreneurship teaching, especially when teachers effectively combine practical experience with theory while learners assume the shared responsibility of learning from experience. As the most recommended instructional methods, one can point to collaborative pedagogical models, namely problem-based learning, project-based learning, peer assessment, design thinking, formative feedback, service learning, and active methodologies that integrate digital technologies.',\n",
       " \"The Conformity of Kolb's Experiential Learning Implementation in Indonesia University's Entrepreneurial Learning Purpose: Entrepreneurial learning at Higher Education (PT; University) level is allegedly still low. Hence, the implementation of experiential learning (EL) serves as an alternative. This study was conducted with the aim of analyzing the conformity of the implementation of EL in entrepreneurial learning in universities. Methodology: This study was conducted using a survey method, on four EL components, namely: concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization, and active experimentation. The research sample constituted 310 students from six universities in Indonesia which were identified using stratified accidental sampling. The instrument was developed from four EL components that met validity and reliability requirements. All research data were analyzed using comparative and conformity analysis. Findings: The results of the study showed that experiential learning process in entrepreneurial learning at universities in Indonesia had not been implemented properly. There was no difference in the quality of EL between accredited universities with superior and good accreditation. There is also no difference in the quality of EL between students from the social science and humanities (i.e., Soshum) group and science and technology (i.e., Saintek) group. The results of the conformity analysis showed that the EL process had not met the student's expectations. Implications for Research and Practice: This study instils hope among students that all aspects of EL can be implemented optimally as an instrument to improve the quality of entrepreneurial learning. This implies that the designing of EL-based entrepreneurial learning is a major concern for the lecturers.\",\n",
       " 'Best practice learning in cooperative entrepreneurship to engage business students in the SDGs This study focuses on the challenge of introducing cooperative entrepreneurship as an option for university business students, as recommended by the Social Economy Action Plan (SEAP) adopted in the European Union (EU). This aim is linked to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4, which calls for efforts to ensure quality education for all. Our study jointly addresses both entrepreneurship and the need for high-quality education among the university students we are analysing. The use of success stories in cooperative entrepreneurship is based on a Best Practice Learning (BPL) methodology. The students under analysis are categorized into two areas of knowledge, law and economics, depending on whether the main content of their studies focuses on aspects of law or on purely economic aspects. The results show an increased interest in cooperative entrepreneurship in all participants after the application of BPL, and a high level of satisfaction with the activities carried out as part of this experience. However, differences were found between economics and law students, with the former having more knowledge about the concept of entrepreneurship. On the other hand, the latter group shows a greater awareness of the importance of cooperativism. The results of this study can provide the basis for new initiatives at the university level, aimed at the promotion of cooperative entrepreneurship in line with its key role in the SEAP and the SDGs.',\n",
       " \"Framework for Undergraduate Entrepreneurship Education in Australia: Preliminary Exploration This study investigates engagement activities higher education institutions have been providing to develop a learning culture as well as entrepreneurship skills for undergraduate entrepreneurship education learners in Australia. This research is intended to explore changes and adjustments made in the curriculum of undergraduate entrepreneurship education programmes in selected higher education institutions in Australia due to uncertainties caused by COVID-19. We focused on six Australian universities offering undergraduate entrepreneurship programmes, which were purposefully chosen. Data and information were gathered from the universities' websites, documents available from the same source, the universities' structure of engagement activities, and their curriculum. Previous literature was referred to for models already proposed and executed. By considering the COVID-19 crisis as well as similar types of future uncertainties, the study has identified the necessity of implementing open innovation and experiential learning models in a blended environment and having strong IT infrastructure for sustainable industry-university collaboration to facilitate a learning culture and develop entrepreneurship skills in undergraduate entrepreneurship education learners in Australia.\",\n",
       " \"The evaluation of higher education policy to drive university entrepreneurial activities in information technology learning This study discusses the role of university and industry in Indonesia's higher education system, particularly in learning information technology and the related fields. Three data sources were used to collect information on learning practices, i.e., the higher education policies representing the government's perspective, the knowledge capitalization practices representing the industry readiness to act as a joint provider of knowledge and skill with the university, and the perspectives of human learner as the subject of learning processes. The study proposes two-stage evaluation on higher education practices that consists of policy analysis and the evaluation of learning practices based on the model of learning system. The former is to map the higher education policy to the spectrum of university entrepreneurial activities, while the latter is the survey on learning practices participated by the industry, students, and alumni. Policy analysis identifies the blank spot on the activities of consulting, spin-off firm formation, and the creation of a technology park. The evaluation of learning practices shows that the university still becomes the dominant actors in the transfer of knowledge and skill, except for the fields of entrepreneurship and project management which the industry excels. These results indicate that university contributes primarily in growing the internal capacity of human resource, while the industry contribute in shaping the professional life. This study suggests that the practice of higher education in Indonesia requires a more aggressive strategy in triple helix relations to enable the achievement of knowledge society and knowledge economy by strengthening the whole spectrum of university entrepreneurial activities.\",\n",

Professional training of the people possessing a wide range of entrepreneurial competencies is becoming an imperative in the conditions of a post-industrial society development characterized by a focus on innovation, priority of knowledge, a high level of competition and involvement of a big proportion of population in service industries. Universities are charged to play a key role in developing highly qualified specialists with an extensive creative and intellectual potential capable of implementing various business projects and becoming a driving force of a sustainable economic growth in their countries. Therefore, there is a big interest in practices of developing graduates' entrepreneurial culture and literacy established in universities of developed countries. Aim. The article is aimed at systematizing the existing experience of the US and UK universities in delivering entrepreneurship education based on academic models as well as considering a possibility of adapting the most efficient conceptions, teaching approaches and techniques within the Russian higher education system. Methodology and research methods. The methods include a qualitative analysis of the concepts entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurial competencies. A case study method was used for describing the academic models applied for teaching entrepreneurship in different universities. Results and scientific novelty. The processes and outcomes of entrepreneurship training in the US and UK higher educational institutions were characterized and compared. The paper provides the description of the academic models applied at the leading universities for providing business education. They integrate the elements of experiential learning, multidisciplinary, multicultural, interactive, learner-centered teaching approaches to developing entrepreneurial behavior patterns, key and variable competencies and soft skills. The paper reveals the problems and drawbacks of entrepreneurship education delivery within the Russian higher education: a discrepancy between the competencies fixed in university curricula and the ones actually needed; an inadequacy of teaching methods and absence of consistency in the course of students' acquisition of theoretical knowledge and practical skills for efficient entrepreneurship activity. Practical significance. The recommendations for improving entrepreneurship education in the Russian higher education system were proposed. The authors grounded a need for implementing an academic model of experiential learning, which enables graduates to develop entrepreneurial competencies and acquire a system of knowledge in the field of entrepreneurship.\",\n",
       " \"Alternatives to the entrepreneurial university: New modes of knowledge production in community service programs Globalisation has significantly altered patterns of research and development, and production. In turn, this has generated new organisational forms and practices in higher education knowledge production. As a result, a strong trend towards the 'entrepreneurial' university has emerged, characterised by increasing market-like behaviour and governance. Within the dominant neo-liberal global consensus, this primarily serves the market and the private good. However, this is a growing counter concern for higher education's contribution to equity, community development and the public good. Drawing from various case studies, focusing on South Africa, this paper identifies the higher education-community partnership model as a complementary alternative to the entrepreneurial university. It is shown that knowledge production in these partnerships closely resembles so-called mode 2, applications-driven knowledge production. Potentially, however, the partnership model integrates and mutually enhances experiential learning, relevant research and community development.\",\n",

Since the perceived entrepreneurial opportunities are the first and most important step in the entrepreneurship process, this study identified the factors affecting the entrepreneurial opportunity recognition in Iranian higher education. Design/methodology/approach - The statistical population included 127 senior undergraduate students in all majors of agriculture at Ilam University. The sample size was determined by using the Krejcie and Morgan's (1970) sampling table to be 100 senior undergraduate agriculture students at Ilam University, Ilam province, Iran, selected through a stratified random sampling technique. Findings - The results showed that the perceived entrepreneurial opportunity among students was moderately low. According to structural equation modeling, the alertness, human capital, social capital and environmental support variables had a positive and significant effect on the entrepreneurial opportunity recognition. Research limitations/implications - Regarding the research implications, the present study, with providing and testing a model for developing the entrepreneurial opportunity recognition among students in a developing country (Iran) with diverse cultures and values, has improved the literature of entrepreneurship in higher education. Practical implications - Based on results instructors in higher agricultural education can use active teaching and learning methods, such as creating ideas, experiential and service learning, teamwork and practical work, critical thinking and problem-solving in education. Also, financial, technical and consultative support of instructors and managers in agricultural colleges to implement, launch and commercialize agricultural students' entrepreneurial ideas and projects is needed. Originality/value - The findings indicated the importance of alertness, human capital, social capital and environmental support on the entrepreneurial opportunity recognition among students. Findings showed that ecological approach could be used to develop students' entrepreneurial opportunity recognition.\",\n",

Yet, understanding the higher education entry decisions of aspiring entrepreneurs is a veritable research lacuna, which creates fertile ground for investigation. This paper reports on an exploratory study investigating the entry decisions of first-year participants enrolled on a recently launched degree programme employing a team-based, experiential approach to learning. The analysis uses an interpretive frame to explore why aspiring entrepreneurs opt for formal education in place of, or alongside, other learning and career journeys. Findings indicate that some participants opted for a university education as part of a positive compromised decision, reflecting the reticence of these aspiring entrepreneurs to 'go it alone' in the world of business. In this sense, such experiential forms of entrepreneurial education may provide a suitable 'middle ground' for some aspiring entrepreneurs.\",\n",
       " \"Are the Teachers and Students Satisfied: Sustainable Development Mode of Entrepreneurship Education in Chinese Universities? Entrepreneurship education plays an important role in sustainable development. Chinese governmental agencies are making all-out efforts to promote schoolwide entrepreneurship education from top to bottom to achieve sustainable economic and social development. This is a phenomenon worth studying and summarizing. Improving the satisfaction degree of teachers and students of entrepreneurship education in universities for sustainable development becomes a typical mode of entrepreneurship education in Chinese universities. The data are derived from 12,269 valid questionnaires in student volume and 1,241 valid questionnaires in teacher volume from top universities in China, and regression and variance analyses were applied. The results show that the overall satisfaction of teachers and students is higher than the national average. There are significant differences in the overall satisfaction of different types of teachers and students. Teachers are most satisfied with the organizational leadership measures of the universities in entrepreneurship education and least satisfied with the lack of professional human resource management strategies for entrepreneurship education teachers. Students are most satisfied with entrepreneurship policy and least satisfied with entrepreneurship learning, especially that entrepreneurship theory learning and practice learning are closely combined with students' majors. The overall satisfaction of students of entrepreneurship education mainly comes from the influence of entrepreneurship policy dividend, entrepreneurship learning, and entrepreneurship competition and entrepreneurship practice, which go hand in hand. The overall satisfaction of teachers is most affected by the satisfaction of organizational leadership, followed by the satisfaction of mechanism guarantee and teaching management. This study introduces the sustainable development model of entrepreneurship education in top Chinese universities through the improvement of satisfaction of entrepreneurship education and has certain reference significance for managers and teachers of entrepreneurship education practice in other developing countries.\",\n",

With an ever-increasing number of new graduates entering the workforce, it becomes almost impossible for every graduate to find employment unless they are equipped with entrepreneurial skills that will elevate their capacity to become self-employed. With this in mind, the Entrepreneurship Accelerator Project (EAP), a tailor-made capstone module was designed for final year students in a private university, with the aim of producing work-ready graduates with entrepreneurial skills. This study will assess how effective the EAP programme is, in developing students' entrepreneurial skills and in preparing them to seize business opportunities, take risks, think strategically, and acquire other future work-ready skills set. The study is based on Schumpeter's entrepreneurial theory of innovation, Kolb's Experiential Theory of Learning and Dewey's educational theory of constructivism. The students' learning experience was assessed through qualitative content analysis of their reflective portfolios. The results demonstrate the positive impact that the module had on students' learning experience and skills development. The module was found to be an innovative and effective tool that enriched students' educational experience, increasing the relevance and practicality of the theories and concepts they learned in the classroom by contextualizing subject matter through real-world applications in tackling business opportunities.

       " \"Developing entrepreneurial and employability attributes through marketing projects with SMEs Purpose - This research aims to assess how marketing-related projects with small-and medium-size enterprises act as a form of experiential learning and help develop entrepreneurial and employability attributes for students in higher education (HE). Design/methodology/approach - The research is based on published material and an evaluation, within HE, of consultancy projects as a final assessment option alongside the well-established dissertation. Findings - External initiatives that embrace experiential learning have helped students develop a better appreciation of client needs, while enhancing their confidence and team-working skills. The institutional degree programme studied is in its seventh year and more than half of students have chosen the project option so far. One key finding is the pivotal role of the academic supervisor and a need for that person to have suitable industry and sector knowledge, as well as effective and empathetic client relationship management abilities. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited to one programme at one university but, as it encompasses a very broad definition of marketing-related activities, covers several years and is part of a longer-term longitudinal study, it constitutes research from which some conclusions can be drawn. Practical implications - In addition to enhancing the students' entrepreneurial and employability attributes, outward-facing activities help enrich the overall student experience and also offer HE institutions an opportunity to raise their profile with external organisations. Social implications - With graduate employability rising in importance, initiatives such as these can help develop important graduate attributes and capabilities. Originality/value - The principal originality and value is that this is a starting point for a potential longitudinal study of the impact of experiential learning and client-orientated projects on graduate career development.\",\n",

Technology enabled learning plays a vital role in contemporary education and blended learning is widely adopted across higher education as a learning mode. In this paper we reflect on the strategies for introducing blended learning in a network of European universities and the first lessons learnt from the experience. A total of 18 universities took part with around 350 students registered in the 2018-2019 academic year. In this report we recount how the lecturers in our network introduced the blended learning in their classes, the different types of lessons resulting from this effort, as well as the teachers' and students' perceptions regarding the blended learning activities performed. Our reflection is focused on the use of blended learning and its positive effect on activating students and development of innovation and entrepreneurship soft skills. The perceptions on blended learning are interrelated, with the success of the blending models depending on the blended learning activities, and how well the respective online contents are embedded into the teaching and learning processes.\",\n",

It addresses how higher education institutions can leverage their embedded role within a community to foster social entrepreneurship, by leveraging adult learning theories of andragogy and heutagogy in (social) entrepreneurship education. Design/methodology/approach This empirical study interviewed ten senior-level academics in the USA, the UK, Ireland and Australia with practical experience in the (social) entrepreneurship and social innovation space. Qualitative methods of structured interviews, coding and analysis were used as an appropriate procedure to examine the political ecology of U-BSEEs and the interconnectedness of its actors. Findings Key findings included criticisms of higher educations' role in society; financial resources and university impact on stakeholders; the potential of student-based initiatives and programs leveraging andragogy and ideally heutagogy adult learning theories; and changes universities could implement to become key actors of U-BSEEs. Student engagement and cross-disciplinary work is apparently the modus operandi to successful university based ecosystem development. Research limitations/implications Research limitations included sample size and lack of junior and mid-level academic perspectives; surveys could be conducted in future research on the topic to generate quantitative data to strengthen findings. Implications of the research suggest that universities possess the necessary resources and personnel to serve as keystone actors of an ecosystem, but currently do not leverage the expertise available to them. Practical implications All respondents concurred that focusing on students as change agents, and building social entrepreneurship education programs could foster a trophic cascade of increased collaboration, economic growth, political capital and social good in the local and regional ecosystem. Originality/value This study is original in its attempt to build on the entrepreneurship ecosystem literature by considering the agency of U-BSEEs from a political ecology lens.\",\n",

We draw on positioning theory to explore a case study of an academic language and learning (ALL) advisor at an Australian university. ALL advisors work closely with students and academic teaching staff to develop teaching and learning practices across institutions. On the basis of the analysis, we argue that the adoption of entrepreneurial subjectivity amongst ALL advisors, although highly responsive to conditions within institutions, is not conducive to the ongoing development of teaching and learning in the sector.',\n",
       " 'Leading entrepreneurial e-learning development in legal education A longitudinal case study of universities as learning organisations Purpose - The study aims to review the entrepreneurial and educational innovations in technology-enabled distance education in practical legal education (PLE) accomplished by a unit on the periphery of a strong research-led university. It also aims to examine the learning organisation (LO) attributes associated with this initiative. Design/methodology/approach - This is a longitudinal case study based on interviews and reflective analysis, and reviewed using three models drawn from the literature: breaking the iron triangle (containing costs; widening access; enhancing quality); a tailored version of distance education appropriate for research-intensive universities; a strategy for successful adoption of disruptive technologies in higher education. Findings - Entrepreneurialism yielded growth (PLE student numbers went from 150 to 2,000 in 15 years) and diversification (two new programmes established). The PLE programme advanced in two waves: the first centred on widening access and the second, on enhancing quality. Costs were contained. Both the presence and absence of LO attributes are identified at three different organisational levels. Research limitations/implications - Challenges to academic identity may act to inhibit educational change, especially in research-strong settings. Practical/implications - Business logic, and the creation and institutionalisation of educational development support - an internal networking group, were keys to success. Organisational learning in complex institutional environments such as universities involves understandably lengthy timescales (e.g. decades ormore). Practical/implications - Technology-enabled disruption in higher education appears relentless.

In this paper, entrepreneurship education development is explored, and important implications for the further improvement of entrepreneurship education are provided. Design/methodology/approach - This study is based on the comparative education research method and proceeds in four steps (i.e. description, interpretation, juxtaposition, and comparison). The U-BEE items are applied to exemplify the similarities and differences of the process by which entrepreneurship education developed in two universities each in Singapore (National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University) and Taiwan (National Taiwan University and National Tsing Hua University). Findings - From the country-based standpoint, the findings include considering broader factors (i.e. history, education) in such a comparison of the similarities and differences among four universities, reflecting the reality in the Asian region and introducing the method application of comparative education research for the first time in entrepreneurship education. From holistic and specific perspectives of U-BEE, the findings consist of presenting similarities and differences based on the comparisons of each item and showing the classified findings. Originality/value - This study provides helpful insights based on the perspectives of academics and practitioners. First, the authors urge the necessity of the theoretical base of teaching and learning in education when universities plan for entrepreneurship education. Second, the authors stress the critical impact of the government on the execution of entrepreneurship education in the higher education context.',\n",
       " 'INTEGRATING ENTREPRENEURIAL SELF-EFFICACY INTO EDUCATION AT UNIVERSITIES Educational institutions are urged to provide more enterprising individuals who will either act as entrepreneurs, or will be able to manage their careers and lives in an entrepreneurial way. The purpose of this study is to address the role of teaching at universities in maximizing entrepreneurial self-efficacy, and to examine the possibility to maximize the likelihood of entrepreneurial behavior by enhancing entrepreneurial self-efficacy with university students. The study investigates the impact that entrepreneurial self-efficacy has on the development of entrepreneurial motivation and behavior using a sample of 324 students of Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek in Croatia. The results of the research indicate that students demonstrate a higher propensity for entrepreneurial behavior and a higher probability of starting their own business if they feel more self-efficient. The research has also highlighted that teaching at universities does not significantly improve the perception of entrepreneurial self-efficacy in students and that firsthand experience has a more important role in that. An important conclusion to emerge from this research is that in order to influence entrepreneurial behavior, it is necessary to make better use of experience-based learning and supplement university courses with components of informal and/or non-formal education.',\n",

Despite scholars' growing interest in both these research streams, scarce consideration is given to the comprehension of their mutual implications and meaning. Design/methodology/approach The paper is based on a cross-case analysis. It compares 16 higher education programmes launched by Universities in Europe aimed to create competences and skills for Circular Economy in students with different profiles. The analysis provides a critical view of the emerging trends for the entrepreneurship education skills and competencies needed for the emerging circular entrepreneurship paradigm. Findings The paper discusses the main trends of Entrepreneurship Education focused on Circular Economy debate at the European level: rationale and learning objectives (why); contents (what), target students and stakeholders (who) and the learning processes (how). Four thematic areas are identified as common patterns: circular economy business model, green supply chain management, technology entrepreneurship and innovation and public policies and institutional frameworks. Research limitations/implications The paper sheds new light on a still under-researched area, suggesting several implications and avenues for future research in Circular Economy and Entrepreneurship Education. Limitations regard the need to analyse education programmes from a larger geographical area, to take into consideration interesting experiences in the rest of the world and to also collect quantitative data. Practical implications Practical implications arise for the development of learning initiatives for the Circular Economy: learning objectives and new thematic areas focused on circular, sustainable and innovative rethinking of the process for creating value in the incumbent companies; exploring meaning and benefits of collaborative approaches and participation in the circular economy innovation ecosystem and developing advanced models for soft-skills development in terms of leadership, motivational and creative skills.

       " \"Beyond entrepreneurship, raising broad academic professionals: Work-based learning in science from the employer's perspective The need for employees in the exact and natural sciences sector with both work experience and academic qualifications, especially combined with an entrepreneurial mindset, is rising. The University of Groningen offers an alternative Master's program entitled Science, Business and Policy (SBP). SBP combines entrepreneurship education with the integration of a disciplinary science domain and thereby prepares students in science advising. This includes a work placement of 6 months, provided by companies, policy organisations and NGOs. To examine the impact of work placements from the perspective of the employer, this article analyses 20 semi-structured interviews with providers of placements. The results show that employers judge students who have undertaken a work placement as attractive future employees, and the quality of science advice given by students is seen as high. From a work floor perspective, work placements are a strong component in the optimal education of future employees. Integrating academic theory and experience in practice contributes to the employability of science students. The impact of work placements goes further than employability, since employers also indicate a direct effect on work dynamics and see the direct impact of advice reports in their organisation. The work-based learning approach chosen to achieve this specific entrepreneurship education fits the need of industry and other non-academic employers.\",\n",

Self-reported learning is analyzed to illustrate ways in which students make use of institutional and social contributions of the university context. Design/methodology/approach The study investigates entrepreneurial journeys of 18 participants, either currently attending or recently graduated from three universities in three countries with both comparable and distinctive contextual elements. In depth analysis of individual life stories, focusing on self-identified critical incidents, is used to illustrate ways in which students, while at university, develop entrepreneurial competence for current and future practice. Findings Formal and non-formal learning remain important foundations for entrepreneurial competence development, delivered through designed content-centric structures. Informal learning - particularly mentor supported socialised learning - centring around the learner is key to solidifying learning towards entrepreneurial competence, through know-how and access to resources. The university emerges as an entrepreneurial learning space where students constitute and integrate learning gained through different forms. Research limitations/implications Cross-cultural analysis is limited as the paper emphasizes the individual's learning experience relative to the immediate university context. Practical implications Universities play a critical role as entrepreneurial learning spaces beyond formal and non-formal learning. This includes dedicating resources to orchestrate informal learning opportunities and enabling interaction with the different agents that contribute to socialised situated learning, supporting entrepreneurial competence development. Universities need to take responsibility for facilitating the entirety of learning. Originality/value Socialised learning in combination with other forms of learning contributes to student development of entrepreneurial competence while situated in the university context.\",\n",

Entrepreneurship education programs have become a prominent feature in the curricula of many universities and business schools. Often it is developed in parallel with national policy, as described for our empirical context of Sweden. We identify four types using broad principles in terms of four different key variables described within. To identify our proposed types, we perform a cluster analysis of all 37 universities with entrepreneurship educations in one country. Previous literature provides mixed evidence about entrepreneurship programs' effect on the likelihood of alumni starting a business afterwards. Our contribution is to specify this taxonomy through broad principles, leading to interesting questions about the competing goals between theory and practice in learning outcomes.

       " \"How Entrepreneurial Education and Environment Affect Entrepreneurial Readiness of STEM and Business Students? A Longitudinal Study This paper explores how entrepreneurial education and entrepreneurial environment affect entrepreneurial readiness (ER) of students from Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM), and business, i.e., economics and management (E&M) studies. Moreover, it examines how the combination of the aforementioned factors affect the difference in ER between STEM and E&M students. The evaluation is performed on the sample of 595 university students. The results show that two sources of entrepreneurial learning, entrepreneurial experience in the family environment and entrepreneurial education at university, combined with the field of studies represent significant factors that predetermine students' ER. To be able to reach the highest level of ER, the combination of having entrepreneurial environment and entrepreneurial education is crucial for both E&M and STEM students. However, since E&M students show higher level of ER, the paper emphasises the importance of fostering systemic entrepreneurial education among STEM students.\",\n",

However, there have been significant changes in how universities train competences related to business skills and entrepreneurship in practice. Whereas entrepreneurship courses used to focus on the different forms of businesses and drafting business plans, the overall perception of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial competences has shifted this toward a more holistic educational approach to develop students' entrepreneurial competencies. In this comparative quantitative case study, we investigate the university students' perception of the development of their entrepreneurial competencies in the case of Proakatemia (Tampere University of Applied Sciences). The aim was to examine how the entrepreneurial competencies are reflected and strengthened in their thinking and everyday functions through the concept of team learning. The survey involved, altogether, 64 students, of which 21 studied in Proakatemia. The results of this study indicate that the team learning concept of Proakatemia facilitates learning entrepreneurial competencies. Therefore, these results provide insights for universities aiming to develop their curricula, programs and pedagogy, thus promoting sustainable societal development. However, we recommend further studies, e.g., from a qualitative point of view, to assess the effective of the concept in other learning environments.\",\n",
       " 'Entrepreneurial learning - a social context perspective: evidence from Kenya and Tanzania Purpose Drawing on entrepreneurship as a social process, the purpose of this paper is to proposes a model of entrepreneurial learning where contextual social and economic structures gain relevance through experiential learning. Concrete experience underpins the emotions, values and interests that support the cognitive and conative processes required to develop an entrepreneurial mind-set. Empirical study undertaken in Kenya and Tanzania explores perceptions of entrepreneurship education (EE) and identify approaches to a social perspective of entrepreneurial learning that is applicable. Design/methodology/approach The study uses a multi-phase approach consisting of desk research, semi-structured interview and a participatory workshop. Entrepreneurship programmes in 18 universities are benchmarked against accepted standards and 68 participants are purposively selected within key stakeholders for the semi-structured interviews and participatory workshop. Findings The findings indicate that entrepreneurship as a value creation process is a shared assertion but the social context informs a construct of learning outcomes, and specifically what characterises an entrepreneur. Entrepreneurial learning is multi-layered and its provision necessitates an engagement with the social context in order to gain relevance for the learners. The learning content should enable learners to develop an understanding of the world alongside knowledge of entrepreneurship. Learning tools should be flexible and action-based, to achieve learning for entrepreneurship as opposed to learning about the phenomenon of entrepreneurship. Ultimately, the value creation process can only happen when learning supports the individual and collective capabilities to transform the social context. Particularly in Kenya and Tanzania, meeting job creation and growth aspirations will require the providers such as universities to work closely with businesses of all sizes, including the informal sector, and the use of innovative learning techniques such as local languages where applicable. These findings have policy and practice implications for HEIs and policy-makers in curriculum design and inclusive learning methods. Research limitations/implications The study comes short on entrepreneurial orientation and its impact on learning outcomes. Further investigation could establish if necessity entrepreneurs differ from opportunity entrepreneurs in the way they learn, so that national policy and curriculum can respond accordingly. With high levels of unemployment in countries such as Kenya and Tanzania, entrepreneurship often presents the only choice for employment or a paid job. Practical implications The study findings indicate the need for educators to develop learning approaches that are informed by the contextual realities of the learners. Policy-makers should also foster the development of curriculum informed by contextual realities, so that learners can make sense of their entrepreneurial world. Social implications Through the adoption of action learning as essential for the process of creation and transformation, the study makes the case for individual motivations in exploring the realities of the local context. Originality/value The study contributes to a deeper understanding of EE from a social context, and proposes a model of entrepreneurial learning which could benefit learners and the community.

Findings - This study developed framework for TEPE within universities from three aspects (center for innovation and entrepreneurship (CIE), technology entrepreneurship professors/educators, and technology entrepreneurship programs/courses). Research limitations/implications - TEPE will have an impact at the individual and enterprise. It prepares students to be responsible, enterprising individuals who become entrepreneurs, enhances life skills and life learning experiences and contributes to economic development and sustainable communities; at the enterprise level, this education is expected to create and operate a new venture, help innovation, enhance the level of competitiveness, and develop a more practical entrepreneurial environment. Practical implications - It is important for practitioners and policy makers to gain insights on how academic entrepreneurship support works elsewhere as inspiration for the further development of their approaches. Social implications - TEPE can assist in obtaining higher economic growth and sustainable development, in keeping up with the fast pace of an open-market capitalist society and in promoting self-employment and training, which all lead to the reduction of unemployment.

A static approach in which students were passive subjects of their own learning processes has now given way to a dynamic model in which students are actively centred. In this context, it is essential to test teaching-learning models that promote students' new role, as well as their effectiveness in helping them acquire competences. This study describes the experience of implementing a project-based learning methodology as a tool to promote the acquisition of a set of skills, both generic and specific, in undergraduate education, more specifically entrepreneurial competences among a group of university students. In order to analyse the impact of the intervention, pre-test and post-test analyses were carried out and confirmed that project-based learning does produce an increased perception of the acquisition of both the generic and specific skills associated with the subject as well as a significant improvement in perceptions of entrepreneurial competence.\",\n",

After more than 20 years of development, it has reached an unprecedented scale. At present, there are many studies on entrepreneurship education for undergraduates in Chinese colleges and universities, but only a few general studies on entrepreneurship education in higher vocational education. Particularly, the analysis of the status quo of students' entrepreneurship education and the research on the improvement of entrepreneurship education has not yet been widely discussed. This research adopted the semi-structured interview method and used purposive sampling to select 8 students with entrepreneurial willingness in lower grades and 8 in upper grades of higher vocational art and design in the Guangzhou area, as well as 8 students who have succeeded in entrepreneurship after graduation, giving a total of 24 students. The interview was designed based on the concept of Entrepreneurial Thought and Action (ET&A) entrepreneurship education. The interview outline was derived from the three aspects of learning, action, and creation. After the interviews were conducted, coding and qualitative analysis were performed to identify the knowledge and skills required by art students in higher vocational colleges to establish a business, and the problems encountered by successful students in entrepreneurship that might be encountered in the future. Based on the conclusions, the method and content of entrepreneurship education in schools could be improved. In addition, the research results showed that to fulfill the aim of entrepreneurship, art and design students in higher vocational colleges need to learn knowledge and skills such as entrepreneurial courses, professional knowledge, and entrepreneurial skills (competition, training, simulation, practice, etc.).

In this paper, we assess the impact of an experiential learning practice on students' entrepreneurial intentions. Moreover, we consider the moderating role of individual characteristics such as gender, age, proximity to entrepreneurship, academic performance, previous work experience, and propensity for risk. We observe the change in a university student's entrepreneurial intention as a consequence of participating in a serious business game. We do not find that participation results in a significant positive general effect.

Universal entrepreneurship education has both the long-term value of realizing the transformation and upgrading of industrial structure and the practical value of alleviating the employment problem of college students. Therefore, how establishing the innovation and entrepreneurship education model in higher education under the environment of big data analysis is a major issue at present and also a key element to achieving the construction goal of modern higher education. In this paper, the entrepreneurship data of colleges and universities are deeply mined by association rules of the Apriori algorithm and clustering analysis of the FCM algorithm. As a result, an entrepreneurship education model is established and practiced in university classrooms. According to the results of the survey after the practice of the entrepreneurship education model, it can be seen that the number of students' participation in innovation and entrepreneurship lectures has increased, and the proportion reached 50%. Innovation and entrepreneurship clubs formed on campus and discipline competitions accounted for 16.00% and 18.00%, respectively. College students' motivations for learning innovation and entrepreneurship education courses are mainly ability enhancement, interest-driven, credit demand, future planning, and influence of others, and they account for 34.00%, 26.00%, 21.00%, 14.00%, and 5.00%, in that order. These indicate that the current group of college students considers the pursuit of knowledge and the improvement of their abilities as the main reasons for undertaking entrepreneurial learning activities. After practicing the entrepreneurship education model, people have increased their knowledge of entrepreneurship theory and are more willing to participate in various entrepreneurial activities.\",\n",

       " \"Building Students' Entrepreneurial Competencies in Chinese Universities: Diverse Learning Environment, Knowledge Transfer, and Entrepreneurship Education Entrepreneurship education is a critical issue for higher education (HE) students, and thus has been on the agenda of national sustainable development in China. However, few studies have approached the enhancement of HE students' entrepreneurial competencies in relation to the perspective of their learning environment. This study developed and employed the Theoretical Model of Entrepreneurial Competencies to examine the path of improving HE students' entrepreneurial competencies. The results reveal that a diverse learning environment is an important external factor in developing HE students' entrepreneurial competencies. Knowledge transfer, self-efficacy, and cognitive flexibility mediate this relationship. Moreover, entrepreneurship education significantly moderates the effects of self-efficacy on HE students' entrepreneurial competencies, but it does not play a moderating role between cognitive flexibility and entrepreneurial competencies. This study provides insights for both policy and managerial endeavors in sustainably advancing HE students' entrepreneurship through an innovative learning environment.\",\n",
       " 'Holistic experimentation for emergence: A creative approach to postgraduate entrepreneurship education and training This article explores the development of a comprehensive and systemic approach to entrepreneurship education at a research-intensive university in the United Kingdom. The exploration is based on two key conceptual challenges: (a) taking entrepreneurship to mean something more than new business creation and (b) differentiating between entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurship training. The author draws on human capital, capabilities and planned behaviour theories together with those of competency-based and experiential learning to make six propositions. The idea is to develop a replicative framework for obtaining insights into the setting of multiple objectives, varied content and a range of pedagogies with which to achieve critical learning outcomes for a set of postgraduate programmes on entrepreneurship in a university context. We distinguish between entrepreneurship education and training but recognize the importance of incorporating both in a curriculum designed to offer a higher education platform for mindset change, critical thinking, problem-solving and individual development capabilities and entrepreneurial value creation in different environments.',\n",

The main focus is how facilitators of learning processes can design learning spaces, where the boundaries of what is expected from the learner are challenged. The aim is to explore the action-based learning processes occurring in experiential learning settings and curriculum development. The case study explores a course in innovation and project management at a university of applied science, and the main data are derived from four focus groups with students. Five different pedagogical learning activities from the course were investigated to provide legitimacy to the implications for entrepreneurship education. The study identified two core themes describing the participants' beliefs and perceptions about the ideal learning environment. Within these core themes, findings suggested five categories relevant to experiential learning settings.\",\n",

Service-Learning (SL) is a teaching innovation method that combines learning and social service objectives to improve educational quality and graduate employability. To date, there are hardly any studies on its global impact on university students. This paper describes and evaluates an SL experience for Sustainability Entrepreneurship in the context of Spanish Higher Education. Based on knowledge acquired in classrooms, multi-disciplinary teams of students from different subjects related to Business Administration offered support to potential entrepreneurs from rural municipalities in the complex task of writing a successful Business Plan for their projects for local sustainability. Within this academic framework, our study has two goals: (1) to assess the self-perception of university students about the improvement in their curricular development, professional skills and civic-social responsibility after participating in the SL experience; and (2) to estimate its possible effect on academic performance. The results show that the students acknowledged they had improved their social and sustainability commitment and their curricular development, and had acquired skills that society increasingly demands from future business professionals. Furthermore, service-students achieved significantly higher academic performance than a control group of non-participating students. These findings highlight the effectiveness of SL to provide a more holistic education for business university students.',\n",

The studied education was implemented using the synthesis of two computer-mediated communication channels. Analysis based on the content analysis of individual portfolios (diaries), which were returned and stored in the asynchronous platform. In the case study environment, the decision of using use two-channel digital teaching platforms (synchronous and asynchronous) seemed to be successful, because dual channels enable wider forms of feedback and student voice activities during and after the lecture. The results of this study encourage educators to use multifaceted digital educational technology in education and as a channel for the student voice also in practice-based subjects, such as entrepreneurship.',\n",
       " \"Creating an entrepreneurial learning environment for entrepreneurship education in HE: The educator's perspective This paper focuses on entrepreneurship educators as creators of an entrepreneurial learning environment in entrepreneurship education. Entrepreneurship education research has concentrated mainly on the subjects of education (i.e. the students) or on the content of learning, leaving individuals with a critical role in entrepreneurship education - the educators - without sufficient attention. In response, the research question for this study is: how do entrepreneurship educators create entrepreneurial learning environments in entrepreneurship education within higher education? The qualitative study draws on the principles of Vosniadou et al. concerning active learning environments by concentrating on interviews with entrepreneurship educators and documentary data. An entrepreneurial learning environment can be defined as a self-regulatory, co-created learning setting in which entrepreneurship students from different backgrounds learn in teams, as the findings suggest that educators emphasise adjustable co-creation within a `given' format involving individuals with complementary skills working in teams. The study contributes to fulfilment of the identified need to understand the educator's perspective, and to share the know-how and educational experiences of entrepreneurship educators. Practitioners can use the findings as a concrete tool for the creation of an entrepreneurial learning environment. They can learn from, adopt and develop the practices discussed when designing learning environments for their entrepreneurship students.\",\n",

The Novum Trivium provides a model for the integration of entrepreneurship into a liberal arts curriculum, so that students learn how to put their knowledge to use and acquire a new language and new cultural understanding to interact globally. The PoPs initiative interlinks firm and university through shared dual roles in each setting, attracting back to the university on half-time basis scientific entrepreneurs from industry to serve as entrepreneurial role models. The Link projects build on ties between a leading entrepreneurial university (Stanford) and an aspiring one (Edinburgh), taking advantage of the fact that each university is already embedded in its region and could be linked to the other's entrepreneurial culture.

In the context of the migration of most of the businesses to the network, the most important skill of an entrepreneur is the ability to build an online business from the very first steps. The basis for this is the creation a start-up in e-learning mode. A sample of Hong Kong and Russian universities has been designed to compare the practices of e-learning in entrepreneurship. It has been confirmed that the introduction of start-ups in e-learning mode in the final year of entrepreneurship education positively affects the development of professional qualities of students both in online and off-line business and helps to better consolidate the material. In addition, based on the work done, a final year model of entrepreneurship education with e-learning has been proposed; it is based on 3 main components (the student as a generator of ideas; the mentor as necessary support, and information online channels as the main source of information) and is aimed at solidifying knowledge through the start-up project defense. The importance of the role of universities in this process has been proved and the idea of involving a business mentor in e-learning process to achieve a synergistic effect has been considered.',\n",

The popularity and prominence of information technology not only changes the nature of knowledge but also restructures higher education, research and learning. It is in such a wider policy context that an increasing number of institutions of higher learning are being established with new missions and innovative configurations of training, serving populations that previously had little access to higher education. Apart from accommodating a larger number of students, higher education institutions are required to improve their administrative efficiency and accountability in response to the demands of different stakeholders like government, business, industry, and labour organizations, as well as students and parents. The present article sets out in this wider context to examine how and what strategies universities in Hong Kong have adopted to promote entrepreneurial spirit and practices by encouraging academic staff to venture in industrial, business and commercial fields. In addition, this article examines how universities in Hong Kong reform their curricula to make students more creative, innovative and international. More specifically, this article reflects upon the role of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR, hereafter) in promoting entrepreneurship, with particular reference to the interactions between the government, the private sector and the tertiary education sector in promoting a vibrant and dynamic economy.

The conceptual model proposed also examines the role of entrepreneurship education in strengthening entrepreneurial self-efficacy. Survey data is analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings indicate entrepreneurial attitudes have the most significant predictive ability on entrepreneurial intention over entrepreneurial education and the manifest entrepreneurial actions of close social groups that have only a moderate influence on EI. The analysis also confirms that entrepreneurship education enhances entrepreneurial self-efficacy. Based on these results, it is recommended that Engineering Schools devote more attention to experiential learning to create favorable entrepreneurial attitudes and develop students' entrepreneurial skills, particularly among those with a high need for achievement.\",\n",

Being able to adjust to new circumstances is crucial, especially in today's world, where uncertainty, volatility, ambiguity, and complexity are ubiquitous. Experiential Learning Theory can be implemented during innovative pedagogical approaches to better prepare students for entering the market as successful entrepreneurs in such a tumultuous time-for instance, an entrepreneurial course might incorporate using business simulation games, such as MonsoonSim and prototype developing software, including Justinmind to experience enhanced experiential learning with thematic goals. In order to strengthen the quality of teaching and learning and foster self-directed learners better equipped to cope with existing challenges, this study investigates the processes of implementing a business simulation game along with prototype development software and distinguishes it from a typical classroom experience. The sample consists of students enrolled in a short summer entrepreneurial course designed by the United Arab Emirates University at the request of the Ministry of Education, United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.), for secondary and higher secondary school graduates. The students from private and government schools across all seven emirates of the United Arab Emirates participated in this course. The online flipped classroom was carefully designed by blending several approaches during the pre-class, in-class, and post-class activities. In order to provide an advanced learning experience, a web-based business simulation game (MosoonSim) and online prototype development software, Justinmind, were introduced during the course. The qualitative and quantitative results show that incorporating business simulation games had a significantly positive impact on students' learning outcomes, such as critical and higher-order thinking, idea creation, and problem-solving capabilities, and improved engagement through an easy, enjoyable, and interactive environment. Furthermore, findings show that the learning outcomes are significantly influenced by the attributes of the group members and their consistency during group activities in a flipped classroom, and assigning a dedicated instructor or a senior group member having solid background knowledge in a particular subject can assist in significantly enhancing the learning outcomes of a whole group.\",\n",

The Role of Psychological Capital, Perceived Learning From an Entrepreneurship Education Program, Emotions and Their Relationships Entrepreneurship education has become a major focus of interest for researchers and national policy makers to encourage students to pursue entrepreneurial careers. The research on entrepreneurship education-entrepreneurial intentions (EIs) has yielded mixed results, and indicates the need to focus on antecedents of EI. More precisely, the aim of this paper was to examine antecedents of students' EI in French entrepreneurship education programs. Participants were 460 French university undergraduates. Structural equation modeling results revealed that students' Psychological Capital (PsyCap) had a significant positive relationship with perceived learning from the program and a significant negative relationship with negative emotions related to entrepreneurial actions. They also show that PsyCap indirectly enhanced EI. More precisely, students with high PsyCap learned more from the program in terms of perceived skills and knowledge and in turn had a higher EI. Moreover, students with high PsyCap had less entrepreneurial action-related doubt, fear and aversion, which also increased EI. This decrease in negative emotions can be explained notably by what students perceived they had learned from the program. This article concludes with the implications of these findings for future research and practical applications.\",\n",

Entrepreneurship education was measured using instruments by Walter and Block (2016) that evaluated the entrepreneurship education provided by faculty. Entrepreneurial intention used a measurement by Vamvaka (2020), which measured students' choice of intention, entrepreneurial career commitment and nascent entrepreneurship.Findings- Entrepreneurship education has a positive association with students' entrepreneurial intentions. The results also evidence higher entrepreneurial intention levels in students from families oriented toward and experienced in entrepreneurship. The results also reveal that student experience and having friends who become entrepreneurs reduce entrepreneurial intention, but the difference is not statistically significant.Research limitations/implications- The main limitation of this survey is that it was drawn from a single university in Indonesia with only domestic students, whilst the study was also designed cross-sectional. Therefore, the generalisability of the results is still limited. This study uses a single item for measuring friends and own influences, which only measure personal experiences. A more multidimensional measure of family, friends and own influence can be further developed to gain more robust results supporting these findings.Practical implications- The study contributes to understanding the role of family-related variables, particularly family entrepreneurial orientation and experiences, on the development of entrepreneurship education and intention in emerging global market forces. Through family engagement in entrepreneurship education, a family can boost students' entrepreneurial intention by delivering various capitals (e.g. business value, financial and social capital) and providing practical learning. The results imply the necessity to conduct new subjects, courses or university programmes that can include family-related business in entrepreneurship education.Originality/value- Despite the expansion of research related to entrepreneurship education and intention, the relationships between perceived experience, family entrepreneurial orientation and students' entrepreneurial intentions have not been adequately studied, particularly in Indonesia. This work contributes to the existing knowledge of entrepreneurship education by providing two moderator variables that may boost entrepreneurial intention: perceived experience and family entrepreneurial orientation. This work demonstrated how perceived experience and family orientation interact with entrepreneurship education and intention.\",\n",

Thus, estimating the effect of entrepreneur education is imperative. According to the Malaysian Ministry of Education (MoE), only 1.7 percent (as of 2013) of university graduates are self-employed, that is managing one's own business or known as graduate entrepreneurs. Consequently, a huge gap exists between what is targeted by the government (5.5 percent by 2015) and the reality (a small number of graduate entrepreneurs). The purpose of this paper is to analyze the factors influencing a graduate's choice to be entrepreneur, particularly the effects of different entrepreneur education, either formal or informal. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 2,300 graduates from Universiti Utara Malaysia participated in this study. Findings - The findings showed that the majority of the respondents are consistent in terms of their intent to become entrepreneurs. Research limitations/implications - Due to time and resource constraints, the data are limited to only one university in Malaysia. It is suggested that future studies include more universities, especially entrepreneurial universities. Although it is believe that public universities' undergraduates population are highly homogeneous, it is good that the findings of the present study to be further validated by future studies using larger sample that consists of varies of public universities. Practical implications - This paper supports government policies in terms of cultivating educated entrepreneur such as promoting the entrepreneurship education among higher institutions of education (MoE, 2007). However, there are negative relationships among higher academic achievement of graduates toward their intention to be entrepreneurs. It is indicated that high academic achievements are negatively related to becoming entrepreneurs. Thus, it is suggested that entrepreneurship education in terms of both formal and informal education be implemented into the curriculum in order to cultivate entrepreneurial intentions. Originality/value - There is still much more to be learned to fully understand the processes that leading to the decision to become an entrepreneur. Nevertheless, the results presented in this paper provide some understanding of the factors influencing the decision to become an entrepreneur among university students and graduates using a convenience sample. Thus, the results are exploratory and subjected to validation by future studies using more representative samples.

On the initiation of students into practices of entrepreneurship (and) education Practicing entrepreneurship is important for entrepreneurial learning in institutionalized education. However, research is attentive to how this challenges conventional learning arrangements and requires teachers and students to change familiar ways of relating and participating. In this study, we investigate the landscape of participation in a case of experiential entrepreneurship education for non-business postgraduate students. Employing the notion of legitimate peripheral participation in communities of practice, we show how students are initiated into entrepreneurship education practice through three modes of participation: compliance, autonomy and authenticity. Even though these participatory modes make sense one by one, their accumulation created tension. Hereby, we illustrate the complex organization of entrepreneurship education as situated social practices. We theorize by employing a practice theory perspective to explore why tensions may be inherent to widely recognized ideals of best practice in experiential entrepreneurship education. This is in contrast to individual learner oriented explanations.',\n",

University-industry collaborative education is a potential solution for both of these problems by bringing together theoretical insights from universities and experiential know-how from industry. However, university-industry collaborative education has not been sufficiently studied to offer clear frameworks and mechanisms to foster effective knowledge exchanges between these two groups. In this article, we propose the metaphor of a trading zone as a potential analytical framework for implementing this method of education. Applying this framework to the analysis of a university-industry collaborative education program, this study proposes that the exchange of knowledge between students and practitioners is the essential learning experience and that it is made more meaningful by the heterogeneity between students and practitioners. The shared language provided by the program and those who deliver it make the exchanges efficient, and the temporary and extraordinary nature of the program accelerate those exchanges. Here, we analyze the case of Osaka University in Japan to illustrate the framework and develop associated propositions to encourage further study and validation of the framework.',\n",

This study constitutes an original investigation dedicated to the cultivation of entrepreneurial education experience within Kazakhstani universities, situated within the context of informational and digital development and the contemporary challenges encountered by all nations in the global arena. The main objective of this research was to determine how the academic performance of students studying entrepreneurship through online courses changed over time. The study enrolled 282 second-year and third-year students of the faculty of public administration, business, and law from one Kazakh university. In this study, an experimental design was employed to ascertain the effectiveness of integrating MOOC through the amalgamation of statistical data analysis and paired t-tests. The primary mode of assessment was testing, encompassing closed-end assessments comprising one hundred questions based on the outcomes of a specific course. Each question held a point value of one, with the maximum achievable score being one hundred points. The authors juxtaposed mean scores across different time intervals to ascertain the intervention's impact on student performance. The Student's t-test was utilized to compare the mean values by identifying significant disparities at the 0.05 level. The academic achievements of second-year students in some disciplines improved after the MOOC implementation compared to Point 1. According to the calculations, there was a significant difference in student performance before and after learning with MOOC; the mean score difference and t-value with the paired value are higher than the t-value in the tests of the first and last assessments. Thus, online courses have shown their effectiveness in improving student performance in all ten subjects of the entrepreneurial course. This contributed to improved efficiency of the educational process and the implementation of information and digital technology in the online environment without losing its productivity. This research is of practical value as it indicates the need to integrate information and digital technologies into entrepreneurial education. Educational institutions, curricula, and scientific research may use these findings.\",\n",

Entrepreneurial learning is an emergent trend that involves a developmental approach to learning in acting on opportunities and experiences. We apply a social practice theory to entrepreneurial learning to advance understanding of the value of entrepreneurial thinking towards informal, experiential and aspirational learning. We position entrepreneurial learning within the social learning and social practice literature in the (1) alternative formats to formal learning, and (2) implications of entrepreneurial learning, as a social practice, for management learning and entrepreneurship education research. Based on a qualitative empirical analysis of a co-created entrepreneurial learning programme for 'Stimulating Entrepreneurial Thinking in Scientists', this study shows that entrepreneurial thinking can be expanded beyond the entrepreneur, and developed by others such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics scientists. With the drive for individuals to become entrepreneurial in their everyday practices, our study contributes towards extending the conceptualisation of entrepreneurial learning through insights from social practice theory. In addition, by understanding the value of entrepreneurial thinking, particularly via non-formal and informal approaches to learning, our research expands underexposed issues of entrepreneurial learning across diverse audiences, contexts and disciplines.\",\n",

Past decades have witnessed a global increase in the provision of enterprise and entrepreneurship education alongside a growing suite of extracurricular enterprise activities. However, there is a paucity of research examining how entrepreneurial learning might be understood in the context of these activities. Design/methodology/approach The study draws on an empirical study of student and educator participants across 24 United Kingdom (UK) universities using semi-structured surveys and in-depth interviews. Three main learning theories drawn from the entrepreneurial learning literature: experiential, social and self-directed learning provided a conceptual framework to frame the research phenomenon. Findings Findings posit that extracurricular enterprise activities provide perceived value in the experiential and social learning opportunities afforded for students. However, these activities are restricted in enabling the experiential learning cycle to be completed due to limited reflection opportunities. Positioning these extracurricular activities outside the main curriculum also empowers participants to self-direct aspects of their learning and develop their autonomous learning capabilities. Originality/value The existing literature focusses upon the entrepreneurial learning processes of established entrepreneurs rather than latent and nascent entrepreneurs within a higher education (HE) setting. The limited literature examining HE entrepreneurial learning does so by concentrating upon entrepreneurial learning resulting from in-curricular activities. This study offers novel insights into students' entrepreneurial learning processes, highlighting the importance of experiential, social and self-directed learning opportunities to the entrepreneurial learning process and the perceived value of extracurricular activities as a platform for these types of learning.\",\n",

It needs specific knowledge, skills, and a mindset of teachers that helps to create a supportive learning environment for learners. The relationship between teachers' mindset and the creation of a learner-centered learning environment is still less studied in entrepreneurship education. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to identify how the university teacher's mindset relates to the creation of a learner-centered learning environment and their support to learners' entre preneurial attitudes and behavior. Learner-centered learning environment was conceptualized using the framework of Self-Determination Theory (SDT). The data were gathered using an online questionnaire completed by 150 university teachers from different higher education institutions in Estonia. The results indicated that university teachers who tend to think that entrepreneurial abilities are fixed traits are also reporting lower scores in using teaching principles that can be described as learner-centered and tend not to purposely support students' entrepreneurial attitudes. Creating a learner-centered learning environment was positively related to learners' entrepreneurial attitude support. The value of the study and contribution to research lies in a better understanding of the relations between university teachers' mindset and their tendency to use teaching strategies that support entrepreneurial learning. This paper positions the growth and fixed mindset theory and SDT within the context of entrepreneurial learning, adding the aspect of teachers' mindset for characterizing the profile of teachers. Also, the difference between entrepreneurship and nonentrepreneurship teachers were investigated for identifying the opportunities of embedding the principles of entrepreneurial learning in subject-specific courses. From a practical point of view, these results are useful for university managers, program managers and educators, including nonentrepreneurship teachers.\",\n",
       " 'The LAB studio model: enhancing entrepreneurship skills in higher education Entrepreneurship is increasingly being included as a component in higher education and training curriculum internationally. This paper introduces a multidisciplinary studio model, called LAB studio model, for higher education established at the Oulu University of Applied Sciences (OUAS) in Finland. This LAB studio model is theoretically grounded in a constructivist view of learning with problem-based education at its core and draws from traditional studio models for training (Schon, 1987). Furthermore, the model merges work-life experience with studio training in a multidisciplinary and multi-professional environment. Using the categories outlined by Bull et al. (2013), this paper compares existing studio training models with the LAB studio model. This comparison suggests that the LAB studio model is more closely aligned with industry needs and work place reality, in contrast to existing studio models, because it focuses on instruction in a competitive structure; integrates experienced professionals and coaches from the industry; includes problems or ideas from industry; and builds multidisciplinary project teams. Overall, it is suggested that the LAB studio model holds promise to more fully integrate entrepreneurial competences in contrast to existing training models. Further research is currently being conducted to explore this hypothesis.',\n",
       " 'Learning Sustainability Entrepreneurship by Doing: Providing a Lecturer-Oriented Service Learning Framework Due to its growing practical relevance, sustainability entrepreneurship receives a high degree of academic attention. However, literature on how to educate sustainability entrepreneurs remains scarce. A promising didactical approach in this context is service learning. We ask if service learning is an effective way to educate sustainability entrepreneurs, and which framework conditions impact those educators. First, we draw on an established sustainable entrepreneurship capability framework and provide direct evidence from entrepreneurship educators about the effectiveness of service learning. Second, based on grounded theory, qualitative interviews with those educators reveal a framework composed of personal and institutional factors that they have to navigate when provide service learning. Our findings contribute to the interface of service learning and sustainability entrepreneurship by highlighting its effectiveness and the framework conditions for educators.',\n",
       " 'The Challenge of Developing Entrepreneurial Competence in the University Using the Project-Oriented Learning Methodology One of the objectives of the United Nations and the European Commission is to encourage the implementation of education plans and strategies to develop entrepreneurial competence. This refers to the ability to identify needs or discover opportunities and to act on them in order to create value for society. This paper aims to demonstrate the impact of the project-oriented learning (POL) methodology on the development of certain generic or transversal competences associated with entrepreneurship among first-year university students in Madrid. The competences associated with entrepreneurship analyzed in this work are: self-awareness, self-reliance, achievement orientation, proactivity, cooperative teamwork, team management, planning and organization by objectives and communication. The study used a single-group pre-test/post-test, quasi-experimental methodology with a sample of over 300 students of the Francisco de Vitoria University (UFV). The results show a significant increase in self-perceived development of transversal competences associated with entrepreneurship. These findings confirm the main hypothesis that POL is an ideal methodology for the development of transversal competences associated with entrepreneurship.',\n",
       " 'Discovering and developing conceptual understanding of teaching and learning in entrepreneurship lecturers Purpose The purpose of this paper is to discover and develop the conceptual understanding of teaching and learning in entrepreneurship lecturers and how this is influencing the change in teaching experience. Design/methodology/approach The study was carried out among Estonian entrepreneurship lecturers who participated in a lecturer-training programme. A qualitative research method was adopted, focussing on thematic analysis. The framework for research and the analysis of results relied on the teaching and learning model, enabling the model to be tested in the context of entrepreneurship education. Findings The results show that the lecturers with learning-centred mind-sets tended to make changes in their teaching approaches and introduced changes in other teaching and learning components, such as the content (learning process) and outcomes of the learning subject. These inconsistent applications of changes justify the need for a systematic approach to entrepreneurship teaching and learning. Practical implications The results of the study contribute to a more systematic understanding of conceptions of teaching entrepreneurship among entrepreneurship lecturers, thereby allowing school management to understand the need for developing staff in addition to curricula. The study results are useful for informing training for entrepreneurship lecturers, designing entrepreneurship courses and choosing the appropriate methodology in such design. Originality/value This paper provides input for creating a conceptual teaching and learning model of entrepreneurship education that contributes to a more systematic understanding of the relationships between the components of teaching and learning when designing entrepreneurship education programmes. In the context of entrepreneurship education, the use of the teaching and learning model is required when considering the timeline between different components of the model. This means that it is important to first make decisions about the presage factors (including conceptual understanding of teachers), which provide the frame (context) for the teaching and learning process, as well as learning outcomes.',\n",
       " \"Absorptive capacity in entrepreneurial education: Rethinking the Kolb's experiential learning theory This study extends Piaget's theory of absorptive capacity to determine the priorities of entrepreneurial education associated with the occurrence of students' assimilation and accommodation. It identifies criteria of absorptive capacity in entrepreneurship education and prioritizes the identified criteria. These criteria are classified into four categories in Kolb's learning theory depending on the following student traits: learning ability, propensity, field of interest, and learning type. The AHP method is applied for investigating priorities of criteria and entrepreneurship education experts at a Korean university conduct a related survey. The most salient finding is that propensity is the most important major factor among the learning approaches. In other words, in entrepreneurship education, absorptive capacity will be more prominent depending on a student's propensity for it. This research also indicates that students with greater logical tendencies have better absorptive abilities. Regarding this study's contribution to theoretical development, it expands the experiential learning literature to the area of entrepreneurship education, yielding results that suggest the identification and prioritization of an individual's trait of absorptive capacity in receiving an entrepreneurial education. Therefore, the new theoretical perspectives indicated in this study reveal that absorptive capacity could best be used in the primary and sub-criteria in the entrepreneurial learning processes. Regarding practical applications, the results of this study could help entrepreneurial educators and offer a better understanding of teaching method adoption in entrepreneurship education. Specifically, if entrepreneurship education is conducted after identifying and analyzing the major factors of students' adaptive skills, the effectiveness of the program will be significantly improved.\",\n",
       " 'How entrepreneurship influences other disciplines: An examination of learning goals Entrepreneurship is now a mainstream curriculum in higher education across the globe. On many campuses, entrepreneurship education programs have expanded to include cross-disciplinary courses that contain learning objectives in entrepreneurship and the home discipline. While research has been conducted on cross-disciplinary entrepreneurship education, little has been published from a curricular diffusion standpoint. Greater insight into curricular adoptions and pedagogical change stemming from cross-disciplinary entrepreneurship is necessary from both a theoretical and practical point of view. This study uses content analysis on 345 learning goals from a massive cross-disciplinary entrepreneurship program and reports on learning themes and pedagogical strategies. Results confirm the role of entrepreneurship education in other fields is to instill entrepreneurship skill sets and to create a bridge to introduce traditional business topics. The roles of specific entrepreneurship topics are uneven. A gap in career preparation foci for self-employment and venture creation careers was also noted, as well as the absence of exit strategy discussions. The study offers a useful methodology that could be adopted by other institutions for comparison purposes. Implications and future research are discussed.',\n",
       " \"Students? intention towards self-employment: An application of ELT theory on the effectiveness of entrepreneurial education types Self-employment taught via entrepreneurial education is among the vital tools that could curb the high unemployment rate and social vices raving countries such as Nigeria. Drawing upon the experiential learning theory (ELT), this study examines the relationship between entrepreneurial education and its types (and formal, informal and non-formal education) on students' intention towards self-employment. We successfully analyzed 532 questionnaires from respondents randomly selected from six federal universities in the southwestern Nigerian region. Employing first-and second-order structural equation modeling to analyze the collected data, we affirm the significant effect of entrepreneurial education on students' intention toward self-employment. However, only the formal education type of the three education types was found to affect stu-dents' intentions. The results aligned with the view of ELT that the absence of one or more ed-ucation types in the entrepreneurial education offered to students might be the crucial reason why fewer than expected students develop the intention towards self-employment after entrepre-neurial education exposure.\",\n",
       " \"Is Corporate Social Entrepreneurship a (So Far) Missed Opportunity for Higher Education Institutions? Evidence from Germany (1) Background: Corporate social entrepreneurship (CSE) is a young phenomenon courting recognition that is attracting increasing attention in academia and corporate practice. Nevertheless, it has rarely found its way into the curricula of higher education institutions (HEI), which raises the question of the concept's potential for further development in the realm of academic teaching; (2) Our study is based on a mostly qualitative research design consisting of expert interviews, focus groups, and a low-standardized survey; (3) Results: Corporate social entrepreneurship is seen as having strong potential to enrich education at institutions of higher learning, to establish new forms of teaching, and to bridge the gap between higher education and society; (4) Conclusions: Although our results indicate industry need and student demand for competent corporate social entrepreneurs, German HEIs have not yet integrated CSE-specific education into their curricula. However, the required competences are covered by CSE-related fields of study, which hampers the holistic education of CSE learners. A CSE curriculum needs to cover core CSE concepts as well as key competences, and the engagement of quadruple helix stakeholders requires an adjustable and transversal approach of curriculum development.\",\n",
       " 'Extracurricular activities and social entrepreneurial leadership of graduating youth in universities from the Middle East We examine the role that extracurricular activities and student-led activity clubs at institutions of higher education play in the development of social entrepreneurial competences of the graduating youth in emerging market settings. Relying on a single case study approach, we adopt a narrative inquiry into the journey of an undergraduate student in the UAE who longed to build a sense of community at his university aimed at generating positive social spillovers. Our study demonstrates the critical role that the sanction-free university environment plays in the activation of social entrepreneurial behaviors and intentions of students in the UAE. Decision makers are urged to reconceptualize the educational institution as a place of not just learning, but also practicing the entrepreneurial skills of the future generation of social leaders. Students who get exposed to practical activities during their studies have an edge in the labor market due to greater employability skills. Universities that invest in social entrepreneurship education contribute to the development of social leaders of tomorrow and also attract more scholarships through their strengthened network of alumni. Our qualitative inquiry seeks to stimulate more scholarly interest in conducting culturally relevant research on student-led social entrepreneurship endeavors in the context of Middle Eastern universities.',\n",
       " \"An evaluative study on the effect of entrepreneurial education curriculum on students at the University of Venda, South Africa This study was conducted amid wider recognition and adoption of the idea of entrepreneurship education within the broader school curriculum. Policymakers, economists and academics' agendas across the globe emphasise entrepreneurial culture and foster entrepreneurial intentions and attributes as mechanisms that provide self-employment which helps re-educate unemployment particularly for vulnerable youth graduates. A survey was conducted amongst 46 out of 69 final year entrepreneurship students from the University of Venda whose data were captured through self-administered questionnaires and interviews. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and content analysis. Findings thereof revealed that the majority of the respondents had a significantly high entrepreneurial intention and attributes to start their own business within two years from their graduation. In addition, the majority of the students indicated that the course delivery should be practical and be learnt through business activities or application of practical cases instead of learning 'about' business. In order to strengthen the delivery of the curriculum, it is recommended that the content, teaching approaches, assessment, etc., be better adjusted to the original intention of entrepreneurship education. Furthermore, a tracing system is recommended in order to follow students' progress over two successive years from their graduation.\",\n",
       " 'Coronavirus (Covid-19) and the entrepreneurship education community Purpose Covid-19 (coronavirus) has significantly affected education communities particularly in terms of the massive shift towards online learning. This has meant a quick transformation of the curriculum and learning styles to a digital platform. Despite the dramatic change, there is a lack of understanding about what this means particularly for the community of entrepreneurship educators in the higher education sector that rely on practical and immersive training for learning requirements. Design/methodology/approach This paper is a literature review that discusses how communities of entrepreneurship education practitioners can deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. A review of the current literature on Covid-19 and entrepreneurship education is conducted that highlights the need to incorporate a community approach. This enables a better understanding about how communities of educational stakeholders including teachers, students and institutions can facilitate a more proactive and positive attitude. Findings The paper finds that managing the Covid-19 crisis is difficult for entrepreneurship educations due to the need for practical and real life examples. This means the use of augmented reality and artificial intelligence is needed to simulate the real environment. This will enable a more community orientated approach to the study and practice of entrepreneurship. Originality/value This paper is among the first to suggest how this change has taken place and what it means for educational management, thereby providing a unique and timely commentary about how coronavirus has altered in positive and negative ways entrepreneurship education.',\n",
       " 'Experiences from COVID-19 and Emergency Remote Teaching for Entrepreneurship Education in Engineering Programmes Education systems and institutions, often historically considered to be resolute, slow-moving entities transformed virtually overnight during the earlier stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating nimbleness in adversity. This paper describes the first-hand experiences of teaching staff and students from a UK university which pivoted to emergency remote teaching for a core second-year module in engineering, focused on entrepreneurship. A range of methods are used including self-reflection, summative, formative, and focus-group student feedback. The paper provides an insight for readers who may be interested in the practical challenges associated with moving from an academic module typically delivered in a face-to-face learning environment accommodating a large student cohort (n = 177), to one that exists entirely in the digital domain. Our results show learning outcomes were fully met despite stark differences in quality of learning environments amongst students. Students reported benefits to remote learning because it offers a blended approach of both asynchronous content and synchronous sessions, with the latter enhancing engagement and providing structure to working weeks. Issues of presence emerged amongst group work: whilst it might be easier to confront some individuals for lack of contribution, it is also easier for those individuals to disengage. There was widespread support for the Microsoft Teams platform amongst students and staff but the former group reported this lacked a social environment in which relationships amongst team members could be nurtured informally, such as was experienced via social media.',\n",
       " \"How do Finnish teacher educators implement entrepreneurship education? Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to ascertain how the people who train Finnish teachers implement entrepreneurship education in the guidance they provide. The authors show how learning through, for and about entrepreneurship manifests in the self-evaluations of Finnish teacher educators. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected in spring 2012 with a quantitative survey questionnaire to 100 teacher educators and training teachers for vocational and general education, to rectors and managers. Findings - The teacher educators used a relatively large number of the pedagogical models and methods pursued in entrepreneurship education, such as problem based learning, experiential and practical descriptions of situations, and they also encouraged their students to take responsibility and to be self-directed. These can be seen to specifically support learning for entrepreneurship. On the other hand there would still be room for improvement as regards the teacher educators' guidance through entrepreneurship. Practical implications - It would be appropriate in entrepreneurship education to take account of prospective teachers' authentic experiences of entrepreneurship. For example, in teacher training greater use could be made of practice enterprises, co-operative operations, on-the-job learning and methods such as the Young Enterprise business incubator. Originality/value - The European Union places particular emphasis on the further development of entrepreneurship education in teacher training. The study opens up perspectives on what kinds of skills teacher educators impart to prospective teachers who will continue in working life until the 2070s.\",\n",
       " \"Applying educational theory to develop a framework to support the delivery of experiential entrepreneurship education Purpose Experiential approaches have become increasingly common in entrepreneurship education in response to calls for different approaches to the traditional didactic process-driven approach. Experiential approaches offer the potential to develop the skills and mindset that are required in entrepreneurship. Research has highlighted the critical importance of educator pedagogical competence in the delivery and quality of teaching and learning in further and higher education. Nevertheless, educator narratives and practices are often based on foundations that suggest a lack in the depth of knowledge and understanding of the underlying pedagogic learning theories and practice. This paper brings educational theory and pedagogic practice together in a three-stage framework of the experiential entrepreneurship learning process to support entrepreneurship educators within further and higher education. Design/methodology/approach This paper reviews and brings together the seminal educational theories and philosophies of constructivism, objectivism, Kolb's (1984) theory of experiential learning, Schon's (1983) reflection-in-action and Mezirow's (1997) theory of transformative learning, to develop a framework which underpins the experiential entrepreneurship learning process. Findings This paper develops a three-stage framework which informs the roles of an educator and a learner in experiential entrepreneurship education within further and higher education, based on educational theories and philosophies that inform the learning process. Practical implications The developed framework supports the pedagogic competence of educators in the delivery of experiential entrepreneurship education through a deeper understanding of the supporting theory that informs the pedagogic practice. This will provide consolidation to enable educators to maximise the effectiveness of their educational practice (Kaynardag, 2019) and can increase the legitimacy of entrepreneurship education (Foliardet al., 2018). Originality/value This paper meets calls in the literature to provide a closer engagement between educational theory and pedagogic practice to afford guidance as to how educators can navigate some of the different educational theories and philosophies to consolidate the effective delivery of quality experiential entrepreneurship education. Applying seminal educational theories and philosophies to ensure the quality of experiential education can support the legitimacy of experiential entrepreneurship education.\",\n",
       " \"An exploration of the Business Plan Competition as a methodology for effective nascent entrepreneurial learning Purpose - Business Plan Competitions (BPCs) are readily prescribed and promoted as a valuable entrepreneurial learning activity on university campuses worldwide. There is an acceptance of their value despite the clear lack of empirical attention on the learning experience of nascent entrepreneurs during and post-participation in university-based BPCs. To address this deficit, the purpose of this paper is to explore how participation in a university-based BPC affords entrepreneurial learning outcomes, through the development of competencies, amongst nascent entrepreneurs. Design/methodology/approach - Underpinned by a constructivist paradigm, a longitudinal qualitative methodological approach was adopted. In-depth interviews with nascent entrepreneur participants of a UK university-based BPC were undertaken at the start and end of the competition but also six months after participation. This method enabled access to the participant's experiences of the competition and appreciation of the meanings they attached to this experience as a source of entrepreneurial learning. Data were analysed according to the wave of data collection and a thematic analytical approach was taken to identify patterns across participant accounts. Findings - At the start of the competition, participation was viewed as a valuable experiential learning opportunity in pursuit of the competencies needed, but not yet held, to progress implementation of the nascent venture. At the end of the competition, participants considered their participation experience had afforded the development of pitching, public speaking, networking and business plan production competencies and also self-confidence. Six months post-competition, participants still recognised that competencies had been developed; however, application of these were deemed as being confined to participation in other competitions rather than the routine day-to-day aspects of venture implementation. Developed competencies and learning remained useful given a prevailing view that further competition participation represented an important activity which would enable value to be leveraged in terms of finance, marketing and networking opportunities for new venture creation. Research limitations/implications - The findings challenge the common understanding that the BPC represents an effective methodology for highly authentic, relevant and broadly applicable entrepreneurial learning. Moreover the idea that the competencies needed for routine venture implementation and competencies developed through competition are synonymous is challenged. By extension the study suggests competition activities may not be as closely tied to the realities of new venture creation as commonly portrayed or understood and that the learning afforded is situated within a competition context. Competitions could therefore be preventing the opportunities for entrepreneurial learning that they purport they offer. Given the practical importance of competition participation as a resource acquisition activity for nascent entrepreneurs, further critical examination of the competition agenda is necessary as too is additional consideration about the design of such competitions and how such competitions should feature within university policy to support new venture creation. Originality/value - This study contributes to the limited literature and studies on BPCs by focussing on its effectiveness as a means of providing entrepreneurial learning for participants. The key contribution taking it from an individual nascent entrepreneur participant perspective is that the competencies afforded through competition participation are more limited in scope and application than traditionally promoted and largely orientated towards future BPC participation. Learning is mainly situated for competition sake only and about participants securing further resources and higher levels of visibility. As the nascent entrepreneurs intended learning outcomes from competition participation are subsequently not realised, the study highlights a gap between the intended and actual outcomes of competition participation.\",\n",
       " 'Can the entrepreneurship course improve the entrepreneurial intentions of students? This study aims to understand whether an entrepreneurship course can improve the entrepreneurial intentions, satisfaction towards the entrepreneurship course and learning efficacy of technical university students. In order to achieve these purposes, this study adopted the pre-test and post-test experimental design for one single subject group and conducted experimental teaching for 18 weeks. During the experiment, in addition to lectures given by the course instructor, experienced speakers with actual entrepreneurial exposure were invited for mentor co-teaching. The results found high satisfaction and better learning efficacy for the above curriculum design and teaching, but the entrepreneurial intentions of students have not been improved. This indicates that with the implementation of the entrepreneurship course, students better understand they are not suitable to pursue an entrepreneurial career. Hence, entrepreneurship education does not teach students to pursue an entrepreneurial career, but to apply what they learned to their future jobs. Mentor co-teaching indeed enhances satisfaction towards the course and the learning efficacy of students.',\n",

While incubators and accelerators are quintessential in Western academic contexts, educational institutions in emerging economies are lagging behind in the preparation of future-ready business leaders via the establishment of hubs that stimulate entrepreneurial intention and diffusion of innovation. Design/methodology/approach In this conceptual paper, the authors seek to contribute to the development of entrepreneurial education ecosystems in less advanced regions of the world through the activation of university-based centers of innovation. The authors rely on a general review of the specialized literature to identify best practice insights pertaining to curriculum design and draw on the combined expertise of the authors' research team in delivering entrepreneurship and innovation (under)graduate courses and executive education programs in emerging countries. Findings The authors conceptualize the mission, vision and curriculum of an innovation hub that can be adopted by any institution of higher education from transitional and emerging market settings to build powerful entrepreneurial mindsets in the future generation of innovative leaders. The proposed innovation hub curriculum incorporates a number of practically relevant and learning boosting activities, including the So, You Think You Can Innovate? competition, networking events and guest speakers and training seminars and workshops. Originality/value To keep up with changing industry dynamics and secure the relevance of their programs, institutions of higher education in emerging economies need to embrace entrepreneurial models of instruction.

Data from 10 unstructured interviews, a series of telephone interviews and an e-mail postcard are reported. The results show that students' motivations for engaging in clubs vary and that they differ between different types of clubs. In terms of entrepreneurial learning students' engagement in clubs and societies provides enhanced opportunities for 'learning by doing' through action and experience. The data show that increased action leads to reflective practice and that social learning is important.

Design/Methodology/Approach: The research was structured as an exploratory research and was conducted by means of a focus group comprised of representatives from Porto Alegre (RS) working directly with higher education and/or playing key roles within the city's innovation ecosystem. The group's discussion was analyzed along with current literature on the topic. Results: The paper provides insightful perceptions of the obstacles faced by faculty members when attempting to develop innovative methodologies within classes so that potential partnerships are fostered by agents of the innovation ecosystem in order to better prepare professionals that will later be inserted in this new innovative scenario. Limitations of the investigation: The present study is structured as an exploratory research based on a focus group discussion and analysis. Thus, as any qualitative approach, it might lack generalizability, once its purpose is to investigate a specific phenomenon and promote further investigation on the issue. However, all discussion from the focus group was analyzed and supported by extant literature on the topic, in order to mitigate such limitation and strengthen the research relevance. Practical implications: The analysis and discussion obtained from both the focus group and literature are imperative on the need of critical changes on universities' organizational culture to support entrepreneurial activities, as well as fostering partnerships with key agents within innovation ecosystems to better prepare professionals to the new market setting. Originality/value: Although some studies investigate the relationship involving universities and Science and Technology Parks, few studies explore how engineering schools' curricula can benefit from such alliances.

Design/methodology/approach A qualitative case study approach is adopted to explore how the cultural environment affects the delivery and application of entrepreneurship education to university students in a Chinese context. Seventeen student entrepreneurs and three lecturing staff members in three Chinese universities were interviewed using a semi-structured interview approach. Findings The findings suggest that while Chinese universities have been importing teaching models and methods of entrepreneurship education from the United States and other countries, both students and educators are starting to recognise the need for teaching methods to be contextualised and designed based on national conditions and cultural characteristics. Findings from this study highlight cultural fusion and collision in the process of importing and implementing entrepreneurial teaching methods. For example, teaching students how to write a business plan appears to offer limited value for students' start-up activities and their venture development. The didactic teaching method centred on teachers without entrepreneurial experience works for the teaching about entrepreneurship but is paradoxical to the goal of teaching for entrepreneurship. Originality/value Little theoretical or empirical attention has been paid to the complexity of the cultural environment of teaching approaches to entrepreneurship education. This paper provides novel empirical insight into why the cultural environment plays a critical role in teaching approaches to entrepreneurship education and how these teaching approaches can be culturally nuanced to better meet the needs of nascent student entrepreneurs in various cultural contexts.\",\n",
       " 'Impact of entrepreneurial curriculum on entrepreneurial competencies among students: The mediating role of the campus learning environment in higher education This study explored the direct and indirect influences of the entrepreneurial curriculum on entrepreneurial competencies, using the campus learning environment as a mediator. In this study, a survey questionnaire composed of 48 items was used to collect data on the entrepreneurial curriculum, entrepreneurial competencies, and campus learning environment from pre-service vocational teachers enrolled in six universities located in Hunan Province, China. The entrepreneurial curriculum has four components, namely, curriculum content, curriculum material, teaching strategies, and feedback and assessment. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used through SmartPLS 3.3.3 to measure the effects. The curriculum content has a direct, significant, and positive influence on entrepreneurial competencies. For the indirect influence, all four dimensions of the entrepreneurial curriculum influenced the campus learning environment, which, in turn, was positively associated with entrepreneurial competencies. The campus learning environment was therefore revealed to play a mediating role between the entrepreneurial curriculum and entrepreneurial competencies. The study explored that effective entrepreneurial curriculum delivery and campus learning environment are helpful for developing entrepreneurial competencies among the pre-service vocational teachers. Universities should take initiatives to update the entrepreneurial curriculum and create a conducive campus learning environment that brings a positive change to develop entrepreneurial competencies among their students.

       " 'Redesigning the Assessment of an Entrepreneurship Course in an Information Technology Degree Program: Embedding Assessment for Learning Practices Entrepreneurship is a novel course in the curriculum for students in the Information Technology (IT) degree program at La Trobe University, Bundoora, Australia. In comparison to other IT-related courses, the Entrepreneurship course seeks to develop business management knowledge and skills; its learning design is thus different to that of other courses in the IT program. The concept of constructive alignment for curriculum renewal suggests that there are several components of good course design. In this paper, we use the principles of constructive alignment to analyze and redesign several components of the Entrepreneurship course. The focus is on reviewing and aligning the assessment tasks to ensure an effective evaluation and the achievement of student learning outcomes. Since assessment drives student learning, we describe the innovative assessment tasks that were implemented to enhance student learning, provide the rationale for the design of these tasks as supported by the current literature, and reflect on possible future improvements. The course redesign process and the constructive alignment and innovative assessment can be applied to other courses in the field, and more broadly to curriculum, teaching, and learning in higher education.',\n",
       " 'Entrepreneurship education: the role of local business Entrepreneurship education is high on political agendas for its contributions to cultural change and economic growth. Scholars have suggested that the local context may influence the results of entrepreneurship education, and have recommended that educators strengthen their relationships with local businesses and help students learn from actual business settings. By combining policy analysis with empirical data, the present qualitative study explores two issues. First, we look at how the role of local business is expressed in entrepreneurship education policy documents. Second, we explore how local entrepreneurial activity and culture may influence how policies are understood and translated into practice at the local level. The findings indicate that collaboration between schools and business life may strengthen, rather than change, existing local development paths.

Design/methodology/approach This paper presents a single embedded case study focussing on mentee students' perceptions of peer mentors' support of their entrepreneurial learning during an experiential master's course. Employing an abductive approach, the researchers conducted cross-sectional, thematic analyses of individual mentee interviews complemented by data from joint reflection sessions, reflection reports and observations during the course timeline. Findings The peer mentors contributed to the mentee students' learning through various forms of support, which were categorised into mentor roles, mentor functions and intervention styles. The analysis found that peer mentors fulfil three coexisting roles: learning facilitator, supportive coach and familiar role model. These roles constitute the pillars of a typology of entrepreneurial peer mentoring. Research limitations/implications This study contributes theoretical and empirical insights on peer mentoring in entrepreneurship education. It represents a first benchmark of best practices for future studies. Practical implications The case study suggests that adding peer mentoring represents more efficient support for entrepreneurial learning than a teacher alone is able to provide. The typology can also be used for training peer mentors. Originality/value The researchers construct a new typology for entrepreneurial learning support, which contributes to theory development within the field of entrepreneurship education.\",\n",
       " 'Entrepreneurship Education Centres in universities: evidence and insights from Italian Contamination Lab cases Purpose Entrepreneurship Education (EE) is increasing throughout the world. In 2012, the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR) financed Contamination Labs (CLabs), which are laboratories that are aimed at developing entrepreneurial mindsets in all university students. This study analyses the entrepreneurial learning process mechanisms adopted in these CLabs. Design/methodology/approach An ethnographic case study was performed in two Italian CLabs from October 2017 to December 2019. Findings Findings demonstrate that the CLabs in Italy are promising Entrepreneurship Education Centres which create programmes to develop an entrepreneurial mindset in students with different educational backgrounds and levels. Interdisciplinarity in the composition of the student teams, virtuous contamination of knowledge and experience between the students and the stakeholders from the entrepreneurial ecosystem are the key pillars to foster an entrepreneurial mindset in all the students. Research limitations/implications The limitations of this work regard the need to expand the analysis to all the other CLabs created in Italian universities. Practical implications The findings provide indications that may be used to guide a university faculty in the design and management of Entrepreneurship Education Centres in collaboration with entrepreneurs, corporations, student clubs, incubators and representatives of the local entrepreneurial ecosystem. Moreover, the results point out a need to develop interdisciplinary entrepreneurial programmes. Originality/value The originality resides in the analysis of a novel type of Entrepreneurship Education Centre in Italian Universities created as the result of an ad-hoc Italian policy.',\n",
       " \"Influence of Socio-Demographic Factors in the Promotion of Social Entrepreneurship: A Service-Learning Programme Social entrepreneurship (SE) is often presented in the literature as the key to solve many of this world's persistent social problems. SE offers a special opportunity to address the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and to boost the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This research examines the effects of Service Learning (SL) on the SE of university students and to examine whether certain sociodemographic factors (i.e., age, entrance studies, family studies, social participation, and employment situation) are associated with students' SE competence development when applying SL. Pre-service teachers (n = 98) of the degree in early childhood education applied a physical education SL programme. We used a quantitative method with a pre-experimental design, using pre-test and post-test measures. The findings obtained show a significant improvement on the SE competence of PSTs, so SL seems a good tool to develop it. The results that analyse the influence of socio-demographic factors do not show significant correlations. There are very few studies focusing on this objective, so it would be interesting to encourage the research community to provide more data in this area.\",\n",
       " \"Designing a sustainability-driven entrepreneurship curriculum as a social learning process: A case study from an international knowledge alliance project Integrating Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) in higher education curricula requires innovative ideas and approaches how to combine educational, sustainability and disciplinary knowledge, skills, experiences, and motivations. Curriculum developers are challenged to be open to new concepts in their discipline regarding what should be taught and how it can be taught to facilitate learning processes to prepare students for shaping a sustainable future. The European project 'Competencies for A Sustainable socio-Economic development' (CASE) follows a participatory, inter- and transdisciplinary approach to design a Master's program on sustainability-driven entrepreneurship. This study presents an analysis of the social learning process that has taken place in the interdisciplinary, intercultural CASE team during the participatory development process of the new Master's program. The methodological design of the study is based on qualitative, participative evaluation research. The process of learning is discussed based on how the group reflected on and developed their action theories on how to design a supportive learning environment in which a Master's program with innovative scopes and goals can be created. The findings highlight the importance of sharing and processing the experiences, mental models and interpretations concerning concepts, ideas, perspectives and new input within the group. This seems crucial for developing the capacity of the group to bring together diverse knowledge and perspectives for innovative, feasible solutions and ideas as well as to cooperate and collaborate effectively as a team. The implications of a culture of dialogue, participation and learning in diverse teams as important principles for developing innovative ESD-based curricula in different disciplines are discussed. It is emphasized that not only students, but also curriculum developers have to acquire the corresponding ESD-related competencies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\",\n",

To clarify the mechanism of the role of entrepreneurship competition on the entrepreneurial competence of university students, based on data from a sample of 170,764 university students from 31 provinces in China, this study constructs a moderated mediation model that focuses on the mediating role of entrepreneurial spirit (ES) in entrepreneurial competition (ECompetition) and entrepreneurial competence (ECompetence) and the moderating role of entrepreneurial practice (EP). The results showed that ECompetition found to have a significant positive predictive effect on ECompetence. ES plays a mediating role in the relationship between ECompetition and competence. The direct predictive effect of ECompetition on ECompetence and the mediating effect of ES on their relationship is moderated by EP. The results provide a new perspective on the impact of entrepreneurship competition on college students' entrepreneurial competence and expands the experiential learning theory in entrepreneurship education.\",\n",

Design/methodology/approach The paper takes a synthesizing conceptual approach, built on developmental psychology, instructional science, expertise research as well as the pedagogy-andragogy discussion and the role of guidance in contemporary entrepreneurship education research. In addition, a new term, odigogy, is developed. Findings Odigogy, from the Greek word odigos (to guide), addresses how to navigate student entrepreneurs in higher education. The term seeks to correspond both to the specifics of entrepreneurship as a subject and the characteristics of students in the classroom who are in a transitional phase between adolescence and adulthood.

       " 'A critical perspective on learning outcomes and the effectiveness of experiential approaches in entrepreneurship education Do we innovate or implement? Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to conduct a critical appraisal of how experiential approaches can more effectively enhance the achievement of desired learning outcomes in entrepreneurship education. In particular, the authors critique whether actual learning outcomes can be profitably used to measure effectiveness; and consider how student performance can be evaluated through the twin lenses of implementation or innovation. Design/methodology/approach - The authors undertook a review of both traditional and experiential approaches to entrepreneurship education. In addition to comparing these approaches, the authors critiqued a number of taken for granted assumptions regarding the effectiveness of experiential approaches to entrepreneurship education and made recommendations. Findings - Although there is a large body of research on experiential approaches towards entrepreneurship education, the authors know little about how these approaches contribute towards the effective achievement of desired learning outcomes. Whilst many authors claim that such approaches are effective, such assertions are not supported by sufficient robust evidence. Hence the authors need to establish more effective student performance evaluation metrics. In particular: first, whether actual learning outcomes are appropriate measures of effectiveness; and second, the authors should evaluate student performance through the lenses of the two Is - implementation or innovation. Practical implications - Whether actual learning outcomes are used as a measure of effectiveness at all needs to be critiqued further. Implementation involves doing things that are determined by others and matching against their expectations, whereas innovation comprises producing multiple and varied solutions that respond to change and often surprise. Originality/value - Through revisiting the discussions on the art and the science of entrepreneurship education, this paper represents an initial critical attempt - as part of an ongoing study - to fill a gap in entrepreneurship education research. The paper, therefore, has significant value for students, entrepreneurship educators and policy-makers.',\n",
       " 'Exploration and exploitation in the development of more entrepreneurial universities: A twisting learning path model of ambidexterity The paper conducts a systematic literature review on the development process of universities towards the entrepreneurial model to provide a conceptual framework and a strategic research agenda. From the analysis of the body of literature on the topic, exploration and exploitation emerge as critical processes in the development of entrepreneurial universities. Nevertheless, the way they are balanced within universities is an under-researched topic. Adapted from the concept of organisational ambidexterity, this paper develops the notion of university ambidexterity to analyse the development process of entrepreneurial universities. To achieve this research aim, a conceptual model is developed by integrating the learning processes of exploration and exploitation to the previous theories used to analyse the entrepreneurial university. As already emphasised in other studies focusing on the role of ambidexterity in different research contexts, this paper proposes an idea of balance over time. The universities need to balance exploration and exploitation in their evolutionary path towards the entrepreneurial model, but it may be not necessary to invest in exploration and exploitation processes simultaneously. On the contrary, it may be most important to oscillate between periods of exploration and periods of exploitation to achieve ambidexterity over time. As a result, the tensions between exploration and exploitation processes generate a twisting learning path for entrepreneurial universities. Finally, the paper proposes an integrated conceptual framework which consists of six constructs, namely internal organisational environment, external environment, university exploration, university exploitation, university ambidexterity, entrepreneurial university performance. The proposed research hypotheses on the interrelationships between the mentioned constructs and the mediating role of university ambidexterity constitute potential areas of investigation to direct future empirical research and further develop the body of knowledge in the field of entrepreneurial universities.',\n",

This study aimed to identify the activities teachers from a Brazilian public higher education institution developed to analyze how these activities influenced undergraduate students' entrepreneurial behavioral characteristics (EBCs). Method. The study applied a mixed method; the quantitative approach used the EBCs measurement instrument (Mansfield et al., 1987), analyzed with the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), prioritizing the most important EBCs in the perception of 792 students. The qualitative approach implemented a semi-structured interview script and content analysis. This approach identified the activities teachers developed and characterized as distinct according to students' perception and their relationship with the EBCs. Discussion. Thus, it was possible to identify that practical activities and those aimed at student autonomy, directed towards reality, with correlations between disciplines, and with interactive participation, dialogue, favorable environment and learning through experience, converge to developing the entrepreneurial characteristics of the students and are being carried out in the classroom. It was also found that commitment was the most evident characteristic. Conclusions. It can be concluded that the institution presents a promising scenario to develop entrepreneurial education. However, the activities currently carried out in the establishment are not efficient or sufficient since, at the same time, as the existence of entrepreneurial activities was proved, the students presented some unsatisfactory EBCs. Therefore, a longitudinal cut is suggested to analyze the EBCs and better understand the students' evolution with the insertion of these practices in the classroom.\",\n",

Medical student entrepreneurship education (MSEE) contributes to the individual and social sustainable development of students in terms of their future careers. To investigate the effect of teacher entrepreneurship on MSEE, a hypothesis model of MSEE that includes teachers' entrepreneurial competence (TEC), teachers' entrepreneurial behaviors (TEB), and co-creation strategy (CCS) was constructed on the basis of symbolic interactionism. A total of 714 samples were collected from entrepreneurial teachers in Chinese medical universities for quantitative analysis. This study confirmed our hypothesis that TEC and TEB have a positive and statistically significant direct impact on MSEE. As demonstrated in the mediation effect test, when CCS was added as the mediating variable, TEC and TEB had a statistically significant indirect effect on MSEE. With empirical evidence from China, the study provided a new perspective for deepening the research on MSEE and laid the foundation for interdisciplinary research on medical education and entrepreneurship education. The findings contribute to entrepreneurial learning and pedagogical practices in medical education for the sustainable development of medical students.\",\n",

To address this issue in the agriculture sector, which is dominant in economic terms in most developing countries, an exploratory combined qualitative and quantitative research was conducted to understand entrepreneurial learning of agricultural graduate entrepreneurs. For the phenomenological study, 14 agricultural graduate entrepreneurs were purposely selected, and for the quantitative study, 92 entrepreneurs were selected through simple random sampling method. The phenomenological study revealed 12 themes on how graduates experienced entrepreneurial learning. Our study finds support for experiential learning, learning by doing, and social learning theories. Nine themes including previous business experience, risk-taking propensity, entrepreneurial persistence, use of various information sources, tendency to be self-employed, concerns about job or career, interest in practical courses and activities, passion for agriculture, and thinking outside the box are internal to the entrepreneur and could be seen as learner identity. The theme of support from family and friends could be seen as a significant external influence. The survey showed that entrepreneurial learning themes were generalizable to the studied population. Although different students can take different learning paths to become the best they can be, our findings suggest that the overall student learning experience can be designed to ensure that graduates are more likely to become entrepreneurs.',\n",

When educators teach entrepreneurship experientially in higher education, a need arises for different procedures for assessment, evaluation and feedback, and the legitimacy of this type of course is often questioned. In traditional courses, students accumulate knowledge and the educator's primary concern is what students learn. When learning 'through' practising entrepreneurship, students and educators must also care about how students learn. While research brought awareness to this area of concern more than a decade ago, feedback and assessment in entrepreneurship education have received very limited attention. This article addresses these issues both theoretically and empirically. The findings allow the authors to map out the feedback mechanisms needed in experimental entrepreneurship education and to provide an embedded two-by-two model that describes the purpose and outcome of the feedback. The findings also suggest an approach for design and assessment that may help resolve the pedagogical and legitimacy challenges of such courses. These contributions are directly relevant for students, educators and administrators involved with entrepreneurship courses, and they may be applicable to a wider range of process-based courses.\",\n",

       " \"Learning Outcomes for Improving Science Entrepreneurship in Higher Education This study's purpose was to investigate the relationships among learning through experience, learning for stress resistance, learning cognition, learning outcomes, the entrepreneurial mindset, and the discrimination of social information. The main research methods adopted in the study were the partial least squares (PLS) and the Sobel test. We adopted PLS to test the relationships between six variables, including mediating and moderating effects. In addition to PLS, this study used the Sobel test to verify the mediating effects. Large samples may cause a mediating effect testing error when PLS is used; however, the Sobel test can resolve this issue. According to our test results, learning through experience and learning for stress resistance can change students' learning cognition and improve their learning outcomes. In addition, an entrepreneurial mindset has a mediating effect on the relationship between learning through experience, learning for stress resistance, and learning cognition. That is, for the student, having an entrepreneurial mindset strengthens the effect of learning through experience, as well as learning for stress resistance, and improves learning cognition. However, the discrimination of social information has a moderating effect on the relationship between learning cognition and learning outcomes. That is, a lower discrimination capability with respect to social information changes learning cognition and results in poor learning outcomes.\",\n",

       " \"Comparison of Two Team Learning and Team Entrepreneurship Models at a Finnish University of Applied Sciences Setting the Scene for Future Development This team learning and team entrepreneurship model of education has been deployed at the Bachelor's level in the degree programmes of IT and Business Administration (BA). In BA studies the students who take part in team learning have specialized in marketing since 2009 at the Saimaa University of Applied Sciences (SUAS). The model called ICT entrepreneurship study path (ICT-ESP) has been developed for IT education. The ICT-ESP has been built on the theory of experiental learning and theories of knowledge creation and knowledge management. The students study and complete their degree as team entrepreneurs. The model has been further developed in the Business Administration Degree Programme with students who specialize in marketing. The Degree Programme in IT at the Bachelor's level was terminated in 2011 by Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture. Currently, there are severe discussions on bringing it back - not as an IT but as an ICT Degree Programme. This article makes a cross-section of what has already been explored with the team learning and team entrepreneurship model and what the next steps will be. It makes a comparison of two originally separately developed models and discusses their best practices. The article also argues whether the upcoming ICT education should be organized in a conventional way - as curriculum of courses, or as expansion of the current team learning and team entrepreneurship model. The data consists of field notes, meeting memos, and dozens of unofficial discussions with colleagues and company representatives. Literature studies made during the ongoing research, development, and innovation (RDI) projects offered an extra view of how the business context is changing and what should be done to make benefit out of the change. The results suggest that the upcoming ICT Degree Programme at SUAS should be integrated into the existing deployment of team learning and team entrepreneurship learning environment. This would foster collaboration between different disciplines, e.g. marketing and ICT. Furthermore, the emerging ideation, service design and experimentation ecosystem which we are developing in ongoing RDI projects, would be strengthened by adding more students focused on ICT competencies into it. The article was later extended to include interview data from 12 themebased specialist interviews where the thoughts of original article were tested among administration of our campus, RDI funder, experienced and former team entrepreneurs, and local entrepreneurs. The results validated the author's previous suggestions of how future ICT education should be organized and also provided some new targets for development. The essential findings were: The future ICT education should be deployed in a way that it a) develops students' entrepreneurial mindset b) offers versatile cooperation possibilities with existing marketing team entrepreneurs and other enterprises, and c) the current ecosystem should be internationalized.\",\n",
       " 'Emotional Experience in Entrepreneurship Education: Emotion as a Learning Dynamics Few studies propose a kind of entrepreneurship education based on experience, although many researches have pointed out that experience is essential for entrepreneurship development. If experience becomes the axis of education, we cannot think of experience without emotion. The relationship between emotion and entrepreneurship education based on experience needs to be better understood. The purpose of this article is to develop knowledge about that relationship, as we focused on the concept of emotional dynamics and the empirical study of educational practices among students of a management undergraduate program at a Brazilian university. Based on the analysis of information obtained from diverse sources (systematic observation, documents, interviews and photos), the emotional dynamics that sustain entrepreneurship education is described, categorized and discussed. The research results contribute to improve the theoretical framework of research on entrepreneurship education. The findings also reveal how fundamental emotions are in order to understand the process of being an entrepreneur.',\n",
       " \"Identifying innovative opportunities in the entrepreneurship classroom: a new approach and empirical test Opportunity identification is often considered the very first step in the entrepreneurial process, and is therefore frequently included in entrepreneurship education programs. In this paper, we examine a unique teaching method (IDEATE), rooted in experiential learning and aimed at developing novice learners' skills for opportunity identification. Using an experimental design, we compare the innovativeness of opportunities identified by undergraduate students enrolled in introductory-level entrepreneurship courses at a southeastern university. Findings show that the opportunities identified by the students in the IDEATE group were significantly more innovative than those identified by students in the passive search group. In addition, student perceptions of fit with entrepreneurship increased for the passive search training group but not for the IDEATE group. We discuss the implications for entrepreneurship education, research, and practice.\",\n",
       " 'Science-based entrepreneurship education as a means for university-industry technology transfer This paper explores the potential of university-industry technology transfer through science-based entrepreneurship education (SBEE). The scientific literature focuses mostly on enabling university-industry technology transfer via university-industry collaboration in research, and not so much in (science) education. The paper identifies four strands of relevant literature for further theorizing SBEE principles to research its contribution to industry-technology transfer: 1. Embedding entrepreneurship education in universities; 2. Balancing theory and practice of entrepreneurship education; 3. Cultivating an entrepreneurial mindset through entrepreneurship education; and 4. Creating spin-offs through entrepreneurship education. One of the main theoretical contributions of this paper is, that SBEE is different from regular entrepreneurship education in its need for being firmly embedded in a science, technology and R&D environment, both within and outside the university. This is important in order to give SBEE students the opportunity to gain experience with handling the hurdles for successful university-industry technology transfer. The main empirical finding is that elements in the program, related to for example the balance between teaching entrepreneurship through theory and experiential learning, are not systematically covered. It means that fundamental questions such as: Can entrepreneurship be indeed taught? Which elements of entrepreneurship can be taught through theory, and which ones must be experienced in practice? are currently left unanswered. Systematic coverage of these questions enables a better exploitation of the possibilities that SBEE offers for university-industry technology transfer.',\n",
       " \"New entrepreneurial worlds Can the use of role models in higher education inspire students? The case of Nigeria Purpose The purpose of this paper is to determine if and how role models presented in entrepreneurship education can influence students' entrepreneurial activity given that the lack of financial and material means render most role models unattainable. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected in three stages from an entrepreneurship workshop programme held in Lagos, Nigeria. Nigerian and European undergraduate and graduate business students worked together to develop sustainable business ideas for the European and African market. In this exploratory paper, the emphasis for analysis is on the Nigerian students. Findings Based on the research results, the authors identified four types of role models and gained insight into how and why they could inspire students at different stages of entrepreneurship education. Research limitations/implications - This research is highly contextual with an emphasis on Europe and Africa. Given the relatively small sample of the European students in this study, this paper only presents findings from the Nigerian students. In view of time and sample size constraints, it would be useful to do a longitudinal international study to compare the approaches taken by European and African higher education institutions to develop an understanding of role models in entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurial activity. Further study is needed to explore whether role models are the way forward to address the processes of student entrepreneurial learning in the context of entrepreneurship education in Nigeria. Further work could also uncover deeper convictions, the attitudes of students with regard to race and gender, and consider implications for practice between university and industry. Practical implications - The paper contributes to the development of entrepreneurship education in the context of Nigeria's emerging economy and makes suggestions on how to stimulate entrepreneurial activity through the targeted use of role models. Social implications - In view of financial, material or societal constraints to attain role models, the result of this study can be applied in other African contexts or emerging economies to develop the understanding of the relationship between role models in the industry, higher education practices and government policy. The findings of this study show that the highest impact gained is from real-life exchanges between students and entrepreneurs. Originality/value Traditional entrepreneurship education fails because the learner's process of integrating and applying behaviours of entrepreneurial examples and programmes is opaque. Research on role models suggests that where they have a positive impact is where they are perceived as self-relevant and attainable. This idea is explored in the particular context of entrepreneurship education in Nigeria in West Africa, which is characterised by highly limited and fluctuating resources despite Nigeria's relative wealth. The authors conclude with suggestions for the use of role models in entrepreneurship education, especially in the Nigerian higher education context. This paper, therefore, contributes to research on entrepreneurship role model education in emerging economies.\",\n",
       " \"Paid work activity and entrepreneurial cognitions of students - evidence from European emerging economies Purpose This paper aims to investigate whether paid work activity (PWA) experience of students from five emerging economies is related to academic results and self-assessment of possessed entrepreneurial traits. Additionally, the authors verify the relationship between obtaining work experience and the willingness to start own business among students. Design/methodology/approach Participants included 3,631 students of the first level of higher education at six universities in five countries (Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine). A survey questionnaire was used which included questions on the previous work experience, paid work during university studies, the assessment of competencies related to entrepreneurship and the assessment of the desirability of entrepreneurship as a career choice. Findings Findings indicate that students who engaged in PWA before studies are more likely to do it during studies. PWA during studies is related to perceiving oneself as a worse-performing student, but also to the perception of oneself as an entrepreneurial person. No such relationship was found for the PWA experience before entering the university. It was also found that students are likely to start their businesses after obtaining work experience. Practical implications Practical implications pertain to the role of the contemporary academic institutions that should consider their approach to enabling students' PWA and teaching them how to engage in it for the benefit of their own and the societies to which they belong. It is argued that it may be particularly essential in emerging economies. Originality/value The correlates of PWA of students have been underexplored. This paper allows broadening the current understanding of this phenomenon. The authors investigated its relationship with feeling entrepreneurial and academic achievements among young people from five emerging economies, which provides valuable insights for policymakers and educational institutions. It is argued that such insights may be particularly essential in emerging economies. Additionally, the authors contribute to advancing two theories that have not been extensively used in the entrepreneurial context: expectancy theory and social learning theory of career development.\",\n",
       " 'Does Reflection Help Students to Develop Entrepreneurial Capabilities? Recently, scholars have suggested that reflection is an important, or even essential, aspect of entrepreneurship teaching. However, there has been little empirical research on the links between reflection and entrepreneurial learning in a university setting. We test the relationship between reflection and learning in a sample of 125 entrepreneurship students. The results show that reflection supports the development of entrepreneurial capabilities as manifested in the change of Perceived Behavioral Control (PBC). We also find that previous startup experience and reflection are positively related to the baseline level of PBC. However, we find no evidence of vicarious learning through family business exposure. Implications for practice and future research are discussed.',\n",
       " \"Integration of Sustainability Awareness in Entrepreneurship Education Compared to topics such as creativity and strategic implementation in entrepreneurship education, sustainability has not been profoundly emphasized in programs. This study seeks to fill this gap by examining cross-cultural differences between the Austrian and Taiwanese educational contexts in terms of sustainability awareness in entrepreneurship among students in higher education. To conduct the study, students from both Austria and Taiwan were interviewed after developing a procedure to cross-examine their activities in programs, workshops, and team projects. The results indicated that students' perception of sustainability differed according to sociocultural background: Taiwanese students tended to prefer individual responsibility and action, whereas Austrian students were more aware of the impact of industry and food production on sustainability. Such an approach could help students in both Taiwan and Austria to attain a better understanding of the sustainability problems that require entrepreneurial solutions. The uniqueness of this study lies in its cross-examination and cross-comparisons of sustainability integration in entrepreneurship education in Austria and Taiwan. Such comparisons provide educators and policymakers the opportunity to engage in cross-cultural exchanges of knowledge and experiences from which they can learn and adapt.\",\n",
       " \"A project-based approach to entrepreneurial leadership education This paper discusses the evolution of the Entrepreneurial Leadership course (ENGR 310), which is one of the four core courses at The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State). The current teaching practices in the course, based on project-based learning practices, have been developed based on a comprehensive review of similar courses and entrepreneurship education literature. This paper discusses the new course curriculum, and relevant innovative changes. The results of a comprehensive assessment conducted to measure student satisfaction and perceptions of the course are included along with a summary of the experience gained while teaching the improved version of the course. In addition to the assessment results, two other results attest to the success of the course: (1) All teams completing the build and sell project made profits. In fact, one team made about $700 in profit, a great accomplishment considering the time they were allotted to work on the project. (2) Most students taking the class, who were not graduating, decided to enroll in the Entrepreneurship Minor. This paper aims to share implementation of these changes as an avenue for entrepreneurship educators to learn from others' experiences, and to contribute to the entrepreneurship education literature.

       " 'What do students think of self-determined learning in entrepreneurship education? Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the perceptions and perspectives of students with regards to self-determined learning in an entrepreneurship education (EE) context and its potential contribution to employability. Design/methodology/approach This research used a mixed-methods approach with a sample of 25 students currently attending a UK higher education institute. The students had access to participation in EE modules but self-determined learning-informed modules or programmes were not currently offered. Students were invited to attend focus groups and as a result of emergent themes, a business school-wide survey was developed. Findings This research makes two tentative contributions to the EE field. First, the findings of this student cohort are similar to those found throughout the UK and the EU with regard to the perception of the value of a degree by students; its contribution to the hidden curriculum; and the importance of practical experience. The research also adds to the field by considering the value of a self-determined learning approach to developing the capabilities and competencies of graduates. This approach to learning in a context of EE was in general well received by potential students, particularly the applied aspect of the programme. However, there is a perception of risk about this approach to learning and students are concerned about the value of a programme like this to employers in general. Originality/value The study contributes to discussions on the value of EE on perceived employability and in particular self-determined learning through entrepreneurship activity.',\n",

An analysis of undergraduate teaching plans Purpose This paper aimed to describe and analyze the contents and methodologies of entrepreneurship education in undergraduate courses in higher education institutions in Brazil. Design/methodology/approach The teaching plans of 113 undergraduate entrepreneurship courses were surveyed and reviewed. Data were subjected to descriptive and content analyses. Findings Courses are offered by public and private universities in Brazil in 56 undergraduate programs in several fields. Lectures are among the main teaching methodologies employed, being mentioned in 98% of the teaching plans analyzed. There is a broad use of active methodologies. About 75% of the contents covered in the courses refer to declarative knowledge of basic concepts and theories and enterprises creation and management skills. The survey showed that 50% of the teaching plans addressed content related to business modeling, and only 18% of these mentioned the use of business model canvas. In addition, contents such as prototyping, minimum viable product, design thinking and pitch are mentioned in less than 20% of the teaching plans analyzed. Originality/value The article contributes to the advancement of the entrepreneurship education theory as it presents a new way to classify the contents of entrepreneurship courses, in light of educational theories, using learning taxonomies. It identifies the main contents, resources, methodologies, evaluation methods and bibliographies used in undergraduate entrepreneurship courses in Brazil.

       " \"Entrepreneurial decision-making in a microcosm This study investigates when, how and why students use opportunity management behaviours (causation, effectuation and bricolage) within a fundraising project that acted as a microcosm of the entrepreneur's world. Such a pedagogical device reveals students' use of different opportunity management behaviours over the different stages of entrepreneurship. Although research has confirmed the use of these behaviours by entrepreneurs, how student entrepreneurs learn, and practice, them, remains underexplored. Causation is the predominant focus for university teaching, yet our data reveal that students adopted all three behaviours at different stages of the fundraising project as they responded to different contextual forces. Our findings suggest that opportunity management theories should take a more prominent role in the higher education entrepreneurship curriculum. Educators also need to provide a better means of facilitating students to learn about, and practice, a greater repertoire of opportunity management behaviours than is currently the case.\",\n",

A special place here is occupied by student youth, who, during their studies, partially already receive the necessary knowledge, skills and experience in the field of entrepreneurship. However, there are certain factors in the academic environment hindering the growth of the entrepreneurial potential of students. The object of the study is a set of theoretical, methodological and practical issues aimed at further shaping of the entrepreneurial potential of students and its enhancement in terms of the academic environment having a significant role of in this process. The objective of the study is to examine theoretical foundations of the concept of entrepreneurial potential, to explore foreign experience in researching the entrepreneurial potential of students, to investigate the role of the university environment of higher education institutions in Latvia in the formation and enhancement of the entrepreneurial potential of students. In order to study the motivation and readiness of students to engage in entrepreneurship and the degree of their interest and need for business education for the commercialization of business ideas, a sociological questionnaire was elaborated and a sociological survey (2020) of students of Latvian universities was conducted. 402 students of different faculties were interviewed: social sciences, humanities, information technology, music and art, mathematics. The authors use various methods including the axiomatic one, analysis and synthesis, monographic method, sociological survey, statistical analysis of quantitative data from a questionnaire survey. As a result of the work done, the parameters of the real and potential engagement of Latvian students in entrepreneurial activity, the main obstacles to expanding the scale of student entrepreneurial activities were determined, the activities implemented in the academic environment and stimulating interest in entrepreneurship and real engagement of students in this activity were proposed. Our analysis of the entrepreneurial potential of Latvian students is extremely important in the study and development of entrepreneurship both nationwide and at the level of individual higher education institutions.

       " 'The Impact of University Innovation and Entrepreneurship Education on Entrepreneurial Intention From the Perspective of Educational Psychology In recent years, innovation and entrepreneurship education is one of the hot spots of higher education research and practice in China. Innovation and entrepreneurship education can be taken as a new direction. Despite the commonly held view that entrepreneurship education drive the promotion of entrepreneurial intention, little is known about the mechanism through which this intervention impacts on entrepreneurial intention. Based on the assimilation learning theory of cognitive structure and the planned behavior theory, the purpose of this work is to analyze the relationship between innovation and entrepreneurship education (IEE) and entrepreneurial intention from the perspective of educational psychology, to explore the influence mechanism of IEE on entrepreneurial intention, and to promote the success of college students in entrepreneurship. In this study, questionnaires were conducted among college students of different colleges, majors, and grades in Anhui province, with the aid of multiple linear regression analysis and mediating effect model analysis. The results show that IEE has positive effect on entrepreneurial intention. In addition, entrepreneurial knowledge plays a mediating role in the relationship between IEE and entrepreneurial intention. And the mediating effect of innovation behavior and entrepreneurial attitude is not obvious. These results are expected to provide evidence for understanding the relationship between IEE and entrepreneurial intention under the background of Chinese education, to enrich and expand the theoretical basis of IEE, and to possess theoretical, empirical, and practical significance for the design and implementation of innovation and entrepreneurship education for college students.',\n",

Design/methodology/approach - A general framework for entrepreneurship education is developed by using theory as well as practical experiences from the fields of business, engineering and pedagogy. The paper is mainly conceptual where the unfolding Swedish practice is used as contextual backdrop. Findings - The FOR/IN/THROUGH/ABOUT (FITA) taxonomy is presented and used to develop three models of how to approach entrepreneurship in higher education depending on purpose. As there exists a didactical divide between entrepreneurial education for business and entrepreneurial approach to teaching and learning, educators and researchers ought to let their specific context influence the adoption of the taxonomy as well as the presented models. Research limitations/implications - The differentiations suggested by the presented models can be used to both structure the designs and limit claims of future research. More heuristic research is called for. Practical implications - The use of FITA in the designing of entrepreneurship education offers new opportunities for enhancing complementary student learning in higher education. Social implications - The study suggests that any political or scholarly initiative must acknowledge the diversity of entrepreneurship education and chose different approaches depending on what is to be achieved.

The results indicate that the cognitive component was a key instrument in forming intrapreneurship belief among students. Meanwhile, motivation is a determining factor that shapes attitude toward entrepreneurship. This study recommends a meaningful learning process that shapes entrepreneurial cognition.

       " \"ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION PROGRAMMES RESEARCH IN RUSSIA: STAKEHOLDER EXPECTATIONS AND UNIVERSITY PRACTICE Introduction. Entrepreneurial education, as an area of educational practice in higher education, is a relatively new area of activity for Russian universities. In this area, due to the special dynamics of development and transformation, especially in a pandemic, there is the most significant gap between the competencies formed by universities and in demand on the la- bour market. The rationale for the research stemmed from two major trends in the economy and society: industry demand for workforce with greater enterprise skills, at the same time a new gen- eration, generation Z, seeks more flexible and more fulfilling career path. Therefore, to address these trends, universities have to diversify the skill set included in the academic curriculum. Aim. This study is aimed at studying the problems of interaction between universities and their stakeholders in curricula improvement. Methodology and research methods. Taken into consideration the regulatory nature of the curricula design in Russian Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) a two-step strategy has been adopted for this research. The first step was a concern with meta-analysis of the com- petencies outlined in Federal State Educational Standard (FSES) in Management through the lens of entrepreneurial competencies. The second step was to investigate inclusion of soft skills in entrepreneurship curricula in across Russian HEIs. To address the objective of research, descriptive statistics and non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test were applied. Results. The research findings suggest in the environment where the degree programmes have to comply with set Governmental standards, curricula in entrepreneurship struggle to develop essential soft entrepreneurial skills. Most of the analysed curricula are heavily loaded with hard and cognitive skills. Even though the government proclaims a need for innovative development of the nation, creative and innovative thinking is not mentioned either in the FSES nor analysed curricula. The research findings also led to a surprising conclusion that very few core 'business' modules include the development of social or action-oriented skills in their learning outcomes. Scientific novelty. The scientific novelty of this study lies in the fact that for the first time the problems of ensuring the development of soft skills in entrepreneurial education in Russia have been studied. Practical significance. The results of the study will find their application in the design of entrepreneurial curricula to achieve the necessary balance of competencies in them.\",\n",
       " 'Using experiential learning to teach entrepreneurship: a study with Brazilian undergraduate students Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide further understanding of entrepreneurship education, seeking to comprehend the use of experience in this context. Based on the theory of experiential learning, the authors sought to develop and test a conceptual model for teaching entrepreneurship at the undergraduate degree level. Design/methodology/approach - Due to the need to develop a model, the authors used design science research as a method to develop and test an artifact. First, bibliographic research was conducted to develop the model, which was then tested through empirical application. This empirical application was conducted at a Brazilian educational institution, with the participation of 110 students. A total of 440 activities were analyzed through content analysis. Findings - The authors found advantages and disadvantages regarding the use of experience in entrepreneurship learning, such as greater student engagement, sense of empowerment and aspects related to the course and assessments. Practical implications - In this paper, the authors offer suggestions for undergraduate teachers and to faculty members on how to teach entrepreneurship, with the student as the main actor in the learning process. Furthermore, the authors have access to a study addressing a contemporary theme that is emerging in Brazilian universities. Originality/value - In this paper, the authors contribute with the debate on entrepreneurship education, realizing that the understanding of this issue continues to require closer study due to a lack of empirical consensus in previous works. Its originality lies in the development and testing of a model for undergraduates, drawn from a theory whose main use is in graduate school.',\n",
       " \"Entrepreneurial education and learning at universities: exploring multilevel contingencies Despite the worldwide increase in entrepreneurship education offered at universities, there is an ongoing debate whether and under which conditions this type of education contributes to students' entrepreneurial learning. Building on human capital theory, we hypothesize that the exposure to various entrepreneurship education initiatives has an inverted U-shaped relationship with entrepreneurial learning outcomes. We also argue that this relationship is moderated by the entrepreneurial experience of the students, the teaching pedagogy applied in entrepreneurial initiatives offered at the university and the prevalence of opportunity-driven entrepreneurship in the country. A multi-level analysis on a cross-country sample of 87,918 students resulting from GUESSS ('Global University Entrepreneurial Spirit Students' Survey') strongly confirms our hypotheses, and allows us to discuss implications for researchers, educators and policy makers with respect to the nature of entrepreneurial learning, the design of entrepreneurial education programs, as well as the contextual conditions that impact entrepreneurial learning outcomes.\",\n",

In spite of acquiring this advanced knowledge, our students are not always aware of the significant added value and the positive elements the master's degree provides for their future professional careers. Moreover, we have observed that students regard the different subjects as isolated blocks of knowledge. To tackle these problems, we have carried out a learning experience based on the creation of a technology-based enterprise (TBE) through the development of a common project (CP). Drawing on project-based learning (PBL) methodology, the CP consists of the identification, development, and final oral presentation of a business model. It aims to utilize sensor data and analysis in different domains. The experience has been highly positive, reducing the gap between studies and business practice, and increasing coordination among teachers.

       " \"Perceived new venture creation speed: The relevance of the university's context and entrepreneurial experience This study scrutinizes how the perceived new venture creation speed is explained by variables connected to the individuals' human capital, the business planning process, and the university's context. The empirical analysis employs an ordered logit model on a sample drawn from the GUESSS databases for 2018 that includes information for 636 Costa Rican university students whoare involved in nascent entrepreneurial activities. The results highlight two different patterns of new venture creation speed among nascent entrepreneurs: older students who are carrying out tasks related to their potential venture-i.e., writing a business plan and searching for external funding-perceive that they need less time to create their new business, whereas university's program learning slows down the perceived start-up speed among individuals with past entrepreneurial experience. Additionally, the findings highlight the importance of business planning tasks for developing practical and strategic capabilities, as well as of the business-specific cumulative knowledge generated by past entrepreneurial experience. Implications on how universities can promote students' entrepreneurial activity by improving their entrepreneurial environment and program learning are discussed.\",\n",

The mediating role of entrepreneurial education PurposeEntrepreneurship is an important paradigm for enhancing the economic well-being of nations. However, despite heated debate about the significant role of entrepreneurial education (EE) in developing favourable entrepreneurial intention (EI), little is known about the role of individuals' entrepreneurial self-efficacy (ES), entrepreneurial motivation (EM) and family support (FS), which the authors investigated in this study.Design/methodology/approachThis study has used a quantitative research design to collect data from 334 young people from various Malaysian higher education institutes using a purposive sampling technique and a deductive approach based on the theory of planned behaviour (TPB).FindingsThe findings revealed interesting insights into the criticality of young people's ES, EM and FS in learning methods, techniques and skills to start new enterprises. Moreover, EE was a significant mediator of the relationship between individual self-efficacy, FS, EM and EI.Originality/valueThis study is among the few to contribute to strategic management scholarship by designing a framework based on the idea that EE relies on diverse factors, particularly ES, EM and FS. These factors encourage Malaysian young people to seek the necessary education to develop favourable EI and launch successful businesses.\",\n",
       " \"Study on the Influence Mechanism of Virtual Simulation Game Learning Experience on Student Engagement and Entrepreneurial Skill Development With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual simulation games have provided an effective teaching method for online entrepreneurship education. By exploring the mechanisms that influence student engagement and learning outcomes from different perspectives, such as game design, team and individual perspectives, numerous scholars have demonstrated that such a teaching method can effectively improve students' engagement and learning performance. However, the existing studies are relatively scattered, and there is a scarcity of studies in which the effects of said factors are considered. Based on the learning process 3P model (presage-process-product) proposed by Biggs (1993), students' perceived experience of game design, teamwork and self-efficacy were taken as variables in the early learning stage in the present study, and the influence mechanism of virtual simulation game learning experience on students' engagement and entrepreneurial skill development was explored, so as to close the gap in existing research. In the present study, 177 college students from Chinese universities were surveyed and the data were surveyed using AMOS 23.0 software. Although the empirical results show that students' goal and feedback  and alternative  experience of game design did not have a significant positive impact on students' engagement, there was a direct and significant effect the development of entrepreneurial skills. Students' experience of teamwork and general self-efficacy could not only directly and significantly affect the development of entrepreneurial skills, but also indirectly affect the development of entrepreneurial skills through learning engagement. The research results are practically significant for teachers in the selection and development of virtual simulation games, can be effectively applied in teaching process management, and can improve students' engagement and learning performance.\",\n",
       " \"A structured method for innovating in entrepreneurship pedagogies Purpose The purpose of this paper is to describe a dynamic and continuous process for evaluating entrepreneurship pedagogies to implement continuous improvement of entrepreneurship education in order to achieve increased student engagement in face-to-face classes. Pedagogy is argued to be a significant contributor to entrepreneurship education programmes, consisting of dynamic activities and initiatives within the scope of defined entrepreneurship education ecosystems. Design/methodology/approach A minute paper was used as a quick and convenient method to obtain qualitative data on student perceptions of different pedagogies. The research adopted an action-research strategy where data were analysed using concept mapping to identify key themes that the educator can use to further develop or modify the pedagogy during course delivery. Findings The research identified student perceptions of the nature of engagement with pedagogies, and of possible improvements that were used by the educator to increase student engagement during course delivery. Different pedagogies were found to have varying outcomes on students' engagement with entrepreneurship learning, and as such, contextual and spatial factors have to be taken into account when implementing new and/or adjusted pedagogies. Research limitations/implications Repeated application of the research method to different pedagogies was carried out in several deliveries of an undergraduate entrepreneurship foundation course in one university. As such, further research requires testing in various institutional and delivery contexts as well as comparisons of learning and other outcomes including entrepreneurial intentions between classes where particular pedagogies may or may not be used. Practical implications The approach described is relatively straightforward to implement, with marginal resource and time. It provides rich data that gives insights into student perceptions of engagement with an individual pedagogy that the educator can use to modify to modify in order to increase student engagement. Originality/value The paper describes a practical method for educators to evaluate and develop optimal pedagogies for a particular class or group of students. This method can be applied to small as well as large class sizes, and data analysis can be carried out in real time to make improvements during course delivery.

       " \"Supporting entrepreneurship students' sense of belonging in online virtual spaces Universities globally are aspiring to grow through investing in the delivery of online learning programmes. However, the attrition rate for online learning is high. It has been noted that those students with a sense of belonging to their course experience increased enjoyment and reduced anxiety and are therefore less likely to withdraw. Yet too often programme design guidance to support a sense of belonging for student communities focuses on localised, full-time and young students rather than older, globally dispersed, time-starved students such as those in the online entrepreneurship programme that is the subject of this paper. The authors explore how a sense of belonging in entrepreneurship students can be supported effectively in a virtual learning space throughout their online degree studies. The research presented adopts an interpretivist perspective and includes interviews with eight students studying a 1-year top-up degree in a UK higher education institution. The teaching and support staff interviewed were based solely in the UK. The data collected were examined using thematic analysis. The paper contributes to the debate about what a sense of belonging means in a virtual space for entrepreneurship students and identifies how such students can feel connected and supported to finish their course.\",\n",

The study gains relevance in the context of students in emerging economies like India, where the digital divide is still on the higher side. The study also seeks to understand the extent to which varying levels of technological self-efficacy moderate the interaction effects of human capital in the aforementioned relationship. Design/methodology/approachThe sample for this study consisted of 330 students from various disciplines, including science, technology and management, who were selected randomly from different universities in India. A self-administered and structured questionnaire was used to obtain responses from the participants. The data were analysed using confirmatory factor analysis (IBM SPSS 23.0), and path analysis was performed using Hayes PROCESS Macro. FindingsThe study's results indicated that learning motivation and PI had a significant indirect effect on students' entrepreneurship intention, mediated through human capital. However, interestingly, the relationships were varyingly influenced by technological self-efficacy as the moderator. Practical implicationsThe contemporary student cohort consists of individuals known as digital natives, who possess a strong inclination towards digital learning and demonstrate innovative behaviour. The insights gained from this study underscore the crucial role of technological self-efficacy in shaping entrepreneurial intentions, indicating the necessity of incorporating technological training and skill development within international business education curricula. Also, the results of the study emphasize the need for integrating PI into business education programs, as it positively influences the entrepreneurial mindset and potential. Originality/valueThis study is pioneering in conceptualizing and testing a model that provides a more comprehensive understanding of student attitudes and outcomes. This understanding can be used to customize entrepreneurial programs to better meet the needs of students.

Students were given challenges related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) during the course and were allowed to recognize their interest in solving these problems. This paper seeks to identify the entrepreneurial profile of university students through their experiences, interests, attitudes, and entrepreneurial skills. Although entrepreneurship courses are offered more frequently in universities, it is necessary to know the characteristics of the students' interest and their abilities to continue strengthening them. The data were collected through a questionnaire conducted with 20 multidisciplinary participants. The analysis compared the results of those who finished the course vs. those who did not to determine the significant differences in their answers. The results showed that the participants generated sustainable business ideas that favor local and global problems. Additionally, the students showed great interest in social entrepreneurship and developing companies based on the knowledge acquired during their university studies. It is recommended to continue with the training so that these ideas can become real ventures through linkages with other actors in the entrepreneurial ecosystem and favor the solution of sustainable problems.

Education has a decisive impact on changes in the way that societies are coping with national, regional, and global challenges and opportunities brought by sustainable development. The paper addressed the lack of capacity of higher education institutions (HEIs) to integrate the principles and practices of sustainable development into all aspects of education and learning, which hampers the capability to act as an entrepreneurial university. Embarking on the path of sustainable development goals (SDGs) requires HEI to design, launch, implement, and customize specific processes architecture to govern the advance of the sustainability approach. The authors applied the process scoping diagram to capture and conceptualize the educational model needed to guide the HEI through the process of change in its daily operations. The SIPOC method (Supplier, Input, Process, Output, Customer) was applied and with the aid of Visio software tool, the processes relationships were articulated and embedded in the educational model of HEI.

For this purpose, the analytical constructs of the Fictive Student and the Fictive Entrepreneur are developed. Design/methodology/approach Through analysis of 86 course descriptions from 81 universities in 21 countries, this study examines the degree to which course descriptions use gendered language, how such language constructs gendered subjects, and the resultant implications. Findings This paper finds that course descriptions are predominantly, but not exclusively, masculine in their language. More importantly, the distribution of feminine and masculine language is uneven across course descriptions. Context variables such as regional or national culture differences do not explain this distribution. Instead, the phenomenon is explained by course content/type; whereby practice-based entrepreneurship courses are highly masculine, compared to traditional academic courses, where students learn about entrepreneurship as a social phenomenon. Practical implications Universities and educators have not taken into account recent research about the real and possible negative consequences of positioning entrepreneurship in a stereotypical, masculinized fashion. This may offer an inexpensive opportunity to improve recruitment and description accuracy. Originality/value The paper's contribution is fourfold. First, it contributes to debates on the gendering of entrepreneurship by extending these into EEd. Second, it extends Sarasvathy's (2004) concern with barriers to, rather than incentives for, entrepreneurship to include EEd. Third, it contributes to the emerging literature on entrepreneurship as practice, by highlighting the masculization of EEd, as it gets closer to practice and the role of language in this.

The authors seek to answer the following research questions: (1) how is the role expectation toward the entrepreneurship education of teachers different from that of students and (2) what are the consequences of these expectation gaps in entrepreneurship education? Design/methodology/approach This study applies an explorative qualitative approach. As the research setting, the authors selected an entrepreneurship education course for advanced management students at a German public university. The authors conducted in-depth interviews with both educators and students to examine how role ambiguity emerges in venture creation courses. Findings This study identified discrepancies between educators and students in their fundamental assumptions regarding the role of educators and students. Such discrepancies are the autonomy-level assumption gap, capacity assumption gap and learning outcomes expectation gap. Based on the findings, this study develops a framework of expectation gaps between educators and students as sources for role ambiguity in entrepreneurship education by extending the role episode model developed in role theory. Research limitations/implications The findings contribute to the extant literature on entrepreneurship education in several ways. First, this study reveals that students in venture creation programs can encounter role ambiguity due to differing expectations about their role between educators and students, which can negatively affect the students' perception of their learning outcome. Second, this study discovered that the possible discrepancies regarding the fundamental assumptions about the role of educators and students pose a challenge to educators. Third, the findings illuminate the importance of understanding the complex identity of students in the context of student-centered entrepreneurship education. Practical implications This study offers several practical implications for entrepreneurship educators in higher education institutions. First, this study reveals the confusion among students concerning their role in entrepreneurship education. As such, it is recommended that educators explain to students the purpose of the student-centered pedagogical approach and the expected role of students in acting as independent entrepreneurial agents. Second, while student-centered entrepreneurship education is based on the fundamental assumption that students are motivated to develop their own startup projects, educators must consider the nature of students' motivation and their overall student-life situation. Finally, this study demonstrates the importance of creating an active feedback loop so that entrepreneurship teachers can be aware of such perceptional gaps between educators and students and understand the sources of these gaps. Originality/value While the extant literature indicates the existence of perceptual gaps between educators and students in the context of entrepreneurship education, how these gaps emerge and influence the outcome of entrepreneurship education remained unclear. One critical reason for the under-investigation of this issue was that existing studies predominantly emphasize the educators' perspectives, although such expectation gaps can only emerge through the discrepant views of two different parties. This study tackled this research gap by considering the mutual perspective of educators and students by applying role theory.\",\n",
       " \"An entrepreneurial view of universal work-integrated learning Purpose Work-integrated learning (WIL) has emerged as a leading pedagogy that blends theory with application. In recent years, policymakers, educators and practitioners have called for a significant expansion of WIL, one which would enable every undergraduate student has at least one WIL experience during their program of study. Despite these appeals, there remains a significant divide between the aspiration of universality and the realities. Consequently, the study asks the following question: How can post-secondary institutions expand their WIL initiatives to universal levels that deliver transformative learning? Design/methodology/approach In this exploratory study, the authors leverage research from entrepreneurship and management to develop a conceptual model of universal work-integrated learning (UWIL). Entrepreneurship and management research is relevant in this context, as the rapid introduction of a UWIL has transformative implications at the level of the individual (e.g. students, faculty), organization (e.g. processes) and the learning ecosystem (e.g. partners, policymakers) - issues at the core of research in entrepreneurship and management over the past two decades. Findings At the core of the authors' proposal is the contention that the high-impact talent challenge and the delivery of UWIL must be reframed as not simply a challenge facing educators, but as a challenge facing the broader ecosystem of the workforce and the larger community. The authors propose the implementation of UWIL through an open innovation framework based on five strategic pillars. Originality/value Ultimately, the findings the authors present here can be leveraged by all members of the learning ecosystem, including administrators, faculty, policymakers, accreditation bodies and community partners, as a framework for operationalizing a UWIL strategy. The study's model challenges all members of this learning ecosystem to operationalize a UWIL strategy. This entrepreneurial reframing introduces the potential for innovating the delivery of UWIL by leveraging the broader learning ecosystem to drive efficiencies and transformative learning.\",\n",
       " \"International habitus, inculcation and entrepreneurial aspirations: international students learning in a Chinese VET college While research continues to document the influence of higher education institutions on students' identities, studies considering how these institutions inform students' post-study aspirations and career pathways remain limited. This paper engages with a new phenomenon - international students in vocational colleges in China - where we examine how the cultural and expressive characteristics of the institution empowered them to imagine their futures. We interviewed 17 international students who hailed from eight different countries and two teachers who are native to China. The data shows that an integrated mode of learning, combining education with ties to enterprise, hands-on experiences and the accrual of social capital in the entrepreneurial field, appears to shape the students' evaluation, perception and decision-making of the field of possibilities and the future direction of their lives after graduation. Drawing on both habitus and institutional habitus, we capture not only what occurs when an individual and institutional habitus aligns, but also where there is disjuncture. The research is of relevance to higher education policies and practices targeting institutional transformations and hence contributes to improving the quality of higher education.\",\n",
       " 'The question of where: entrepreneurship education beyond curricular practices Purpose This article aims at the understanding of specific spaces where entrepreneurship education (EE) happens - inside and outside the classroom. Design/methodology/approach Building on frameworks such as formal versus non-formal entrepreneurial education and institutional versus non-institutional actors, this research applies structural equation modeling (SEM) to explore which spaces entrepreneurs attended as undergraduate students. Going beyond intentionality, the authors collected data from 175 respondents in Brazil, all of the respondents are entrepreneurs whose companies are at least one year old. Findings Results demonstrate that student-led activities are as important as institutional ones when training future entrepreneurs, while specific in-classroom activities feature the lowest impact among the institutional ones. Research limitations/implications Sample size and characteristics could impact the generalization power, but, since the results fit within research criteria, researchers can benefit by reflecting over new research horizons, going beyond classroom studies and understanding the university as an ecosystem of learning interventions. Practical implications Results can be useful to university managers when designing institutional policies, fostering a diverse set of undergraduate experiences towards entrepreneurship training. Originality/value Although current literature has focused on classroom education, researchers have been pointing out the need of stepping out of the classroom, analyzing other spaces such as student-led movements, co-curricular programs and more.',\n",
       " \"Student perception of their knowledge of social entrepreneurship: gender gap and disciplinary analysis of an Ashoka Changemaker campus in Latin America Purpose - The objective of the study was to analyze the perception of knowledge and experience development in social entrepreneurship in students of a university certified by Ashoka as a Changemaker campus and to identify data that argue for equitable training among all students regardless of gender and discipline studied. Design/methodology/approach - The authors evaluated the perception of knowledge about social entrepreneurship of a group of students from a university certified as Ashoka Changemaker Campus to check if there are differences by gender and disciplinary area. The population was 140 students, to whom a validated instrument was applied. Findings - The results shed light on the few differences among students in the business, engineering and health sciences disciplines compared to those enrolled in the humanities and social sciences concerning knowledge and experience in social entrepreneurship. The findings also indicate gender equality in the perception of knowledge and experience of innovation and social entrepreneurship. Research limitations/implications - The sample size in the different disciplinary areas is a limitation of this research. However, the findings are valuable in terms of gender and the study being conducted in the first university certified as a Changemaker Campus in Latin America. Practical implications - Underlying the statistics and the hypotheses is important in improving students' experience and expanding their equitable opportunities to learn about and implement innovative proposals for social entrepreneurship projects. Social implications - Training in equality and inclusion contributes to an equitable and socially just society, especially when this training aims to bring new possibilities to society. This study links with those that have been conducted in other institutions, where conscious efforts have been made to reduce the gender gap or differences by disciplinary area when undertaking social entrepreneurship projects that connect sectors for social benefit. This research also argues for the need to identify the impact of other cultural elements, in addition to the knowledge provided by universities, that reduce the gap among their students. Originality/value - This study is original because of its hypotheses about university students' social entrepreneurship projects, being conducted in a special environment (Ashoka Changemaker campus) in Latin America. The data were analyzed under hypothesis testing, contrasting the empirical evidence with the theoretical assumptions.\",\n",
       " \"A Quantitative Enhancement Mechanism of University Students' Employability and Entrepreneurship Based on Deep Learning in the Context of the Digital Era This paper adopts a deep learning approach to analyze and study the mechanism of quantitative enhancement of college students' employment and entrepreneurial abilities in the context of the digital era. The deep learning connotation is predetermined as five abilities, which are metacognitive ability, active communication and cooperation ability, deep processing ability, creative practice ability, and learning empathy experience, and, based on this, the deep learning questionnaire is designed, and it is reclassified by exploratory factor analysis to reduce the dimensionality, and the specific indicators and scientific connotation dimensions of the deep learning questionnaire are determined; and, through the deep learning of each dimension, the problems of deep learning of college students are examined and in-depth analysis is conducted, and the inner relationship and correlation among the dimensions of deep learning of college students are derived through correlation analysis. The success of innovation and entrepreneurship depends on the innovation and entrepreneurial ability of college students, and the formation of the ability influenced various factors. Therefore, not only is studying the influencing factors of college students' innovation and entrepreneurship ability in line with the requirements of the times and social development, but also it can solve real problems. This thesis adopts a combination of two methods, qualitative research and quantitative research, to study the influencing factors of college students' innovation and entrepreneurship ability and tries to ensure the scientificity, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of the conclusion. In this paper, we analyzed the requirements of the employment prediction system for graduating secondary school students, carried out the software framework and database design of the employment analysis and prediction system for secondary school students, and designed the system modularly based on the analysis results. By applying the proposed deep feedforward neural network prediction model to the prediction system, a software system applicable to the employment prediction and guidance of secondary school students is implemented.\",\n",
       " 'Assessing the status of entrepreneurship education courses in higher learning institutions The case of Tanzania education schools Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to assess the status of entrepreneurship courses offered in education schools. It provides recommendations for how to address the existing challenges by developing entrepreneurship initiatives in education schools. Design/methodology/approach - A survey was circulated to the management of all education schools in Tanzania, respective entrepreneurship educators and graduates from these schools. Random sampling was used to select teachers who had graduated from education schools. Findings - The findings show that all education schools have an entrepreneurship module in the development studies course, which is mandatory for all students in first year. From 2008 to date, six education schools (31.6 per cent) have introduced stand-alone courses at undergraduate level reflecting entrepreneurship in their title and 68.4 per cent are planning to introduce entrepreneurship courses both at undergraduate and postgraduate level. Although entrepreneurship educators demonstrate subject specialty, they use traditional teaching and assessment techniques. The lack of books on entrepreneurship and the large number of students were cited as the main challenges affecting their role as subject facilitators. Research limitations/implications - The study was limited to education schools in higher education institutions. Similar studies in non-business disciplines need to be conducted to establish how entrepreneurship is developed among graduates of higher education institutions. Practical implications - The study recommends that the management of all education schools should be made aware of the need to provide courses in entrepreneurship, to integrate experiential learning and innovative techniques in the teaching and assessment processes and to involve students in extra-curriculum activities. Originality/value - This is the first study to be conducted in Tanzanian higher education institutions that focuses on the teaching of entrepreneurship to education school students.',\n",
       " \"Motivational catalysts: the dominant role between prosocial personality and social entrepreneurial intentions among university students Purpose - Social entrepreneurship has the potential to address societal challenges, and high-education students are expected to be future social leaders. However, engagement in social entrepreneurship remains low in many countries. This study aims to investigate the mediating role of motivational mechanisms (i.e. self-efficacy, social support and social worth) in the relationship between prosocial personality and social entrepreneurial intentions (SEIs). Design/methodology/approach - Based on the theory of planned behaviour, the authors conducted a survey of 292 valid respondents from 35 major public and private universities. The collected data were analysed using the structural equation modelling technique. The reliability of the measurements and the model's predictive capabilities are substantial and assured. Findings - The findings suggest that prosocial personality alone does not directly predict social entrepreneurial behaviour. However, motivational forces are dominant mediators in the relationship between prosocial personality and SEIs. Specifically, self-efficacy, social support and social worth significantly mediate this relationship. Research limitations/implications - The findings of this study provide insights into why prior studies on this topic has produced contradictory results. Practical implications - The authors recommend that universities and policymakers provide adequate cognitive learning experiences, capacity-building programmes, funding support and recognition to enhance graduates' inner strength and foster SEIs. Originality/value - The empirical results resolve the contradictions found in many prior studies and highlight the importance of supportive mechanisms when promoting SEI in emerging regions.\",\n",

The concept has evolved from academic entrepreneurship, which gained prominence in the 1990s, into a more comprehensive notion at institutional level and has been an influencing factor for governmental decisions and the region's economic development. This study seeks to present an overview of the evolution of entrepreneurial HEI research and provide a description of the structures characterizing it. This paper presents an in-depth examination and analysis of the current state of research and published literature related to entrepreneurial HEIs. A descriptive bibliometric analysis coupled with content analysis is presented, incorporating citations included in Scopus' multi-disciplinary database over the last 25 years. Two software packages-VOS viewer and Bibliometrix R were employed to probe the research questions and create visualizations of the bibliometric networks. Thematic mapping of the multifaceted research field is illustrated and emerging trends of are identified. Findings suggest that the research on entrepreneurial HEI has been pioneered by USA followed by UK and other European countries. Moreover, the research seems to be fragmented and more focused on only entrepreneurial universities. Future research needs to consider colleges and smaller institutions alongside larger universities. Also, further steps need to be undertaken to encourage and enable cross-border international collaboration, so as to draw learning together from different national and regional contexts.\",\n",
       " \"An entrepreneurship education taxonomy based on authenticity The future engineer is labelled an entrepreneurial engineer, having networking, teamwork, opportunity recognition, creativity, risk management, and discipline-specific skills. Therefore, entrepreneurship education is being increasingly introduced in engineering education. The various educational designs used to introduce entrepreneurship education have been discussed extensively, but a clear scheme for the classification of such methods is not available. In this study, a classification scheme for entrepreneurship education is introduced by building on prior frameworks and authentic learning situations to differentiate educational approaches and learning contexts. We explore and combine different models of entrepreneurship education offered at 10 technical universities in the Nordic countries. Through this exploration, we identify three categories of learning contexts, which we label 'imitation', 'pretence', and 'real,' adding to the three classes of educational conceptions identified in the literature and verified through empirical data: 'teacher-directed', 'participatory', and 'self-directed'. This leads to a six-class taxonomy for entrepreneurship education approaches.\",\n",

       " \"Utilisation of entrepreneurial experiences in student-driven mentoring processes Following the educational perspective of community of practice, students learn from engaging with people sharing the same interests as themselves. Previous research has shown that students in entrepreneurship education learn from other community members' experiences and have addressed learning outcome from peer mentoring. This study explores how students acting as peer mentors utilise their own entrepreneurship experiences from doing entrepreneurship in peer mentoring of nascent student entrepreneurs. The mentoring is provided by a venture incubator functioning as a community of practice. Five peer mentors in the extracurricular student venture incubator are observed during peer mentoring of a total of nine student entrepreneurship groups and then interviewed about their mentoring practices. Our findings show that the peer mentors' experiences from entrepreneurship studies are utilised in the preliminary stages of mentoring processes, while experiences related to the venture creation processes are utilised later. This implies that when peer mentors relate theoretical knowledge to business experiences from ven -ture creation processes, they help to make both theoretical knowledge and the venture creation process itself more understandable for student entrepreneurs. This study contributes to the entrepreneurship education literature by illustrating how entrepreneurship experiences are uti-lised in peer mentoring provided through a community of practice.\",\n",
       " \"Facilitating Students' Creativity, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship in a Telecollaborative Project In this study, telecollaborative learning activities were carried out in virtual learning environments created by the 360-degree video technology. We aimed to facilitate students' creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship. Two groups of students, a group of junior high school students from China (n = 15) and a group of university students from Indonesia (n = 10), participated in the study. Students created cultural learning content using the 360-degree video technology which considered to be creative, innovative, and entrepreneurial, shared it with their international partners on the telecollaborative platform and then watched content of their partners to experience virtual panoramic tours. After that, students exchanged their ideas and comments with each other in order to improve content quality. We investigated whether participation in telecollaborative learning activities positively impacts students' creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship. The data were collected through questionnaires and interviews. We also analyzed content created by the participants in learning activities. Two main findings were obtained: (1) technology-supported learning activities improved participants' creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship and (2) the participants positively perceived their learning experiences. Based on our results, we proposed several suggestions and derived some implications.\",\n",

The way to achieve that status is promotion of Entrepreneurship. There is seeming consensus on the importance of entrepreneurship in ameliorating some socio economic problems especially poverty, unemployment and all sorts of social vices in the society. More and more business students view the possibility of starting and operating their own business as a viable alternative to being employed by an established company. In the quest to enhance students' learning and cope with the 'knowledge' economy challenges, higher education institutions are embedding entrepreneurship education programs in their curricula. Linking entrepreneurship to education would mean re-orienting present education to a specific result oriented objective wherein the students will be linked to various functions and responsibilities expected to be carried out by an entrepreneur, whether technical or managerial. The case mentioned below is of a student entrepreneur from Bharati Vidyapeeth Deemed University, Institute of Management. Kolhapur, (BVDUIMK) Maharashtra. The case highlights the journey and characteristics of the student entrepreneur and the barriers faced while charting his path. The study aims to inspire other students to take up entrepreneurship.

A multiple case study of Chinese entrepreneurial learning Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the institutions involved in providing experience to entrepreneurs in China and analyzed the types of experience they provide. Moreover, the abilities of related organizations to shape experience were analyzed. Design/methodology/approach - By using a multiple case study method, this qualitative study examined various entrepreneurial experience providers (namely incubator, entrepreneurship training institution, franchise store, entrepreneurship training network, and family business experience transfer) to understand the experience types and their supplying competencies. Findings - On the basis of the types of entrepreneurial experience and the criteria for entrepreneurial competency assessment, the study results showed that the primary providers in China are the Start Your Business (SYB) program, incubators, and family businesses. Furthermore, for-profit social training organizations provided less experience than did governmental or private ones. The five providers mainly provided know-what entrepreneurial experience. Among the providers, family businesses and SYB offered experience that was conducive to entrepreneurial learning. Research limitations/implications - Entrepreneurs are the subjects of entrepreneurship education, while this study mainly focused on analyzing the experience supplying competencies. Thus, future studies should explore the required abilities that are developed during entrepreneurship for various learners. Practical implications - This study interpreted how to achieve Chinese mass entrepreneurship and innovation strategy in the context of the low development of entrepreneurship higher education. To improve their competencies in providing experience, providers must focus on developing proper curricula, effective transfer methods and teacher resources, and incorporating entrepreneurship education. Originality/value - On the basis of social learning theory and human capital theory, this study developed a set of criteria for the assessment of the ability of entrepreneurial experience providers. This study analyzed how related institutions enhanced entrepreneurial experience, thereby expanding the relevant learning channels and providing options for entrepreneurs to accumulate experience in China.',\n",
       " \"A Brief Review of Our Agile Teaching Formats in Entrepreneurship Education Companies are confronted with increasingly demanding environments, including globalization, technologization, intergenerationality, and crises such as the coronavirus pandemic. To accept uncertainties as a challenge and to recognize opportunities for development, well-educated and resilient founders are needed who can foster innovation and sustainable development within society and the economy. The majority of today's entrepreneurs have an academic background. Hence, institutions for higher education need to provide comprehensive educational offerings and support initiatives to train and sensitize future entrepreneurs. Therefore, since 2013, agile teaching formats have been developed in our project at a Bavarian university of applied sciences. In two stages, we founded a limited company for hands-on experimentation with entrepreneurship and also conceptualized an elective course and an annual founders' night. Based on a theoretical model and continuous teaching evaluations, we adjusted the individual modules to suit the target group. The objective is to promote the acquisition of key competencies and exert a positive influence on the startup quotient in the region. There are six startups by students who can be traced back to our project. This indicates that a target-group-oriented educational program encourages motivation and awareness of entrepreneurial thinking and action among students.\",\n",

Also, entrepreneurship has emerged as a critical aspect of engineering education with various disciplines worldwide. The objective of this work is to share the recent educational experience that integrates entrepreneurship into one course of the Degree in Chemical Engineering of the University of Granada and how the entrepreneurial activities develop an entrepreneurial mindset in chemical engineering students. The paper contains some strategies for internalising entrepreneurial spirit. The originality is mainly due to the coupling of waste management and entrepreneurship learning for increasing entrepreneurial skills in chemical engineers specifically. The study was carried out among chemical engineering students who participated in the 'Solid and Gaseous Waste Treatment' optional course. Mainly, a qualitative research method was adopted. The primary data for the evaluation of entrepreneurial activities were collected with validated questionnaires distributed to students.

       " \"Revisiting Vico's Pedagogy of Invention: The Intellectual Entrepreneurship Pre-Graduate School Internship Debates regarding higher education's relevance and responsiveness to societal exigencies have in the past three decades resulted in the development of programs with leitmotifs such as service learning, problem-based learning, and civic engagement (e. g., Scholarship on Teaching and Learning, McNair Scholars, etc.). A recurring theme in these enterprises has been the emphasis on honing students' capacity for criticism. And while this faculty is valuable, it may be ultimately insufficient for students' active and productive problem-solving and concrete engagement. Heuristically employing Giambattista Vico's rhetorical pedagogy, this essay investigates a programmatic effort to respond to this overly critical orientation. I explicate a formal parallel between the criticism launched, on one hand, by the Intellectual Entrepreneurship Pre-Graduate School Internship at the University of Texas at Austin against public research universities, specifically the elimination or reduction of structural and instructional ambiguity and prioritizing of criticism, and, on the other hand, by Vico against Cartesian skepticism, specifically the critical teaching methods generated therein. I thus articulate a model of invention as taught through practice, and advocate a pedagogy based on this revitalized invention, demonstrating its utility in students' realities.\",\n",

In order to achieve this objective, this paper addresses the problems detected in the degree subject UD - which entails the creation of a business plan - and the proposal of improvements in the teaching-learning process of this subject. Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative and quantitative analysis are used. First, the paper reports the problems that occurred during two academic years (2012-2013 and 2013-2014), as well as the solutions to these problems, in the two academic years that followed (2014-2015 and 2015-2016). Second, the improvements achieved are analyzed using descriptive statistics and the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, based on data drawn from the records and a survey conducted in 2012-2013 (174 responses), and in 2015-2016 (184 responses). Findings - The results outline the positive effects on students' learning outcomes and academic excellence, a three-stage assessment process, the strengthening of the coordination and supervision systems and the enhancing of entrepreneurial spirit among graduates, with a UD connected to a business incubator. Practical implications - The authors describe the design and implementation of a UD that provides a major step in the students' entrepreneurial education, emerging, not only, as an opportunity to train and connect skills and knowledge learned about the starting a new venture, but also as a practical experience of entrepreneurship; a first step that introduces the student to entrepreneurship. Originality/value - There are very few examples of concrete subject designs that have undergone in-depth, longitudinal research, focusing on entrepreneurship. Prior research has focused on entrepreneurship primarily as a subject, forgetting the great utility of the UD as active training tool. Thus, this paper breaks new ground by highlighting the role of the UD in entrepreneurial education. In this regard, the UD allows the student to be guided and to actually engage in the real- world practice of entrepreneurship. Specifically, it encourages them to apply their academic knowledge of the field in the context of creating a new business. Moreover, by creating a business plan, students are applying the knowledge and skills learned in the subject of entrepreneurship with other spheres of knowledge and skills.\",\n",

To explore this phenomenon, we completed 10 qualitative interviews at ten different higher education institutions across Norway in fall 2020. The informants were strategically selected among employees who had been involved in open platform technology, MOOC production and support for faculties. Adopting thematic analyses, we found entrepreneurs who positioned themselves in pockets of innovation with the intention to transform teaching and learning. Rather than seeing technological innovations as more of the same, the entrepreneurs embraced the possibilities emerging in new educational practices. Inspired by New Institutionalism, we focused on the organizational conditions for MOOC production. The entrepreneurs often entered interpretive struggles at higher organizational levels in competition with other stakeholders. Despite national initiatives and funding, many stakeholders questioned the value of MOOCs. Our study points to discrepancies in understanding the disruptive and transformative change that new technology can bring to study programs and lifelong learning. The informants also experienced insufficient support from leaders and lamented the lack of a national platform for open online access. We link these findings to embedded theories, belief systems and discourses in educational cultures and management in Higher Education.',\n",
       " \"An enquiry into potential graduate entrepreneurship Is higher education turning off the pipeline of graduate entrepreneurs? Purpose - In today's global economy, high in talent but low in growth, the capability and skills mismatch between the output of universities and the demands of business has escalated to a worrying extent for graduates. Increasingly, university students are considering alternatives to a lifetime of employment, including their own start-up, and becoming an entrepreneur. The literature indicates a significant disconnect between the role and value of education and healthy enterprising economies, with many less-educated economies growing faster than more knowledgeable ones. Moreover, theory concerning the entrepreneurial pipeline and entrepreneurial ecosystems is applied to graduate entrepreneurial intentions and aspirations. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Using a large-scale online quantitative survey, this study explores graduate ''entrepreneurial intention in the UK and France, taking into consideration personal, social and situational factors. The results point to a number of factors that contribute to entrepreneurial intention including social background, parental occupation, gender, subject of study and nationality. The study furthers the understanding of and contributes to the extant literature on graduate entrepreneurship. It provides an original insight into a topical and contemporary issue, raising a number of research questions for future study. Findings - For too long, students have been educated to be employees, not entrepreneurs. The study points strongly to the fact that today's students have both willingness and intention to become entrepreneurs. However, the range of pedagogical and curriculum content does not correspond with the ambition of those who wish to develop entrepreneurial skills. There is an urgent need for directors of higher education and pedagogues to rethink their education offer in order to create a generation of entrepreneurs for tomorrow's business world. The challenge will be to integrate two key considerations: how to create a business idea and how to make it happen practically and theoretically. Clearly, change in the education product will necessitate change in the HE business model. Research limitations/implications - The data set collected was extensive (c3500), with a focus on France and the UK. More business, engineering and technology students completed the survey than others. Further research is being undertaken to look at other countries (and continents) to test the value of extrapolation of findings. Initial results parallel those described in this paper. Practical implications - Some things can be taught, others need nurturing. Entrepreneurship involves a complex set of processes which engender individual development, and are highly personalised. Higher Education Enterprise and Teaching and Learning Strategies need to be cognisant of this, and to develop innovative and appropriate curricula, including assessment, which reflects the importance of the process as much as that of the destination. Social implications - The global economy, propelled by the push and pull of technology, is changing at a speed never before seen. This is having profound political, social and economic effects which necessitate fundamental change that we organise ourselves and our activities. Current models and modus operandi are proving increasingly unfit for purpose. Nurturing and encouraging agile mindsets, creativity, supporting the testing of new ideas and ways of doing things and adapting/adopting to innovation are all critical future employability factors. Our future prosperity and well-being will be dependent on creating new learning models. Originality/value - This work builds on an extensive literature review coupled with original primary research. The authors originate from a variety of backgrounds and disciplines, and the result is a very challenging set of thoughts, comments and suggestions that are relevant to all higher education institutions, at policy, strategy and operational levels.\",\n",

Design/methodology/approach This study employed the single case study research method. Purposive sampling was used to select the participants. The sample consisted of 142 key informants, whose responses were analysed using a direct content analysis method. Findings From the students' perspectives, entrepreneurial role models indirectly influenced their entrepreneurial skills. Practical implications The findings have clear implications for educators and policymakers. Educational institutions should design and implement educational strategies that help connect informal learning gained from the family with formal training at higher education institutions. On-the-job or apprenticeship training should also be included as a component of course content. Originality/value Our findings regarding the influence of role models differ from those of previous studies in relation to two of the four role models considered here. First, according to the students, their family environment has no direct impact on their entrepreneurial skills. In addition, science- and technology-based educational environments should adopt an entrepreneurial orientation to help students understand various market and business pressures, which will enable them to make a positive contribution to the workplace.\",\n",
       " 'Teaching science and technology PhD students in entrepreneurship-potential learning opportunities and outcomes Whilst doctoral students comprise a large group of researchers at a university and will potentially play important roles in the utilization and transfer of research results, prior research studies have paid little attention to the effect of entrepreneurship education on PhD students with a science and technology orientation. This paper seeks to address this gap in knowledge and examines four key elements in the design and evolution of good practice in entrepreneurship education for this group of students: (1) learning tools, (2) inspiration, (3) interdisciplinarity, and (4) boundary spanning networks. The paper illustrates the importance of identifying the balance between theory and practice that will attract students from across the spectrum of science and technology fields. It also shows that a hands-on experimental methodology is an effective pedagogical strategy that uses learning by doing as an essential tool in problem solving.',\n",
       " 'Replicating the networking, mentoring and venture creation benefits of entrepreneurship centres on a shoestring: A student-centred approach to entrepreneurship education and venture creation As support for both university-level entrepreneurship education and the use of experiential learning methods to foster student entrepreneurs has increased, so too has the number of university-established or affiliated entrepreneurship centres. This study focuses on an activity designed to combine experiential learning methods with assets associated with entrepreneurship centres, including venture creation, networking and mentoring. Students were invited to participate in a competition in which they were guided through the business creation process and pitched their ideas to investor judges who chose the winner and provided capital start-up funding and consulting. In light of this research, the authors suggest that university faculty at institutions without entrepreneurship centres can organize experiences to provide the benefits of entrepreneurship centres. The study found through the use of interviews that many of the benefits of entrepreneurship centres could be replicated in this way. The specific project is outlined, outcomes are analysed and the results and lessons learned are discussed.',\n",
       " 'Role of personality traits for entrepreneurial intentions of young entrepreneurs: A case study of higher education institution Pakistan being a young country is struggling to provide employment opportunities. However, entrepreneurship is a perceived strategy for reducing unemployment. The trend of entrepreneurship is also emerging among university students. Thus, the ratio of entrepreneurial intention and start-ups is also increasing among university students and graduates. Therefore, this study aims to examine the role of personality traits in the entrepreneurial intentions of young entrepreneurs. Considering this, qualitative methodology was employed with the case study as the research design. A single case of a university with three different departments was taken. In total, n = 9 entrepreneurs were purposely selected from business (n = 3), computer science (n = 3), and education (n = 3) departments. The data were collected using semi-structured interviews and documentary analysis of their ventures and success stories. This study followed research ethics, including volunteer participation, confidentiality, and reciprocity. The collected data were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. The findings reveal three main themes: the desire to be an entrepreneur, learning attitude, and personality traits are the leading factors in the entrepreneurial intentions of students and graduates. However, within these themes, the effect of personality traits (consistency and determination, discipline and locus of control, and risk-taking and tolerance) is found to lead to entrepreneurial intentions among young entrepreneurs. This study concludes that most entrepreneurs believe that the role of personality traits is evident in entrepreneurial intentions. Moreover, the personality traits are further strengthened with entrepreneurial experience and help continue entrepreneurship.',\n",
       " 'The influence mechanism of the relationship between entrepreneurial learning and entrepreneurial intention Based on relevant literature, this study adopted entrepreneurial learning theory to construct a relationship model between entrepreneurial learning and entrepreneurial intention. In this framework, entrepreneurial learning was divided into three dimensions: entrepreneurial education learning, experiential learning, and social network learning. A questionnaire survey was conducted among 1,399 undergraduate students in Zhejiang Province to investigate how entrepreneurial learning influenced entrepreneurial intention, while considering the mediating effect of entrepreneurial self-efficacy. This empirical research found that: (1) experiential learning and social network learning had significant positive impacts on entrepreneurial intention, but there was no significant relationship between entrepreneurial education learning and entrepreneurial intention; (2) entrepreneurship education learning and social network learning had significant positive relationships with entrepreneurial self-efficacy, but experiential learning had a significant negative relationship with entrepreneurial self-efficacy; and (3) entrepreneurial self-efficacy partially mediated the relationship between experiential learning, social network learning, and entrepreneurial intention, and fully mediated the relationship between entrepreneurial education learning and entrepreneurial intention. These findings suggest that colleges and universities in China could broaden entrepreneurial learning and strengthen social network learning.',\n",
       " \"Supervised entrepreneurial work-integrated learning Experiential learning is increasingly being recognized as the preferred teaching method in entrepreneurship education, with particular emphasis on students' real-world' experience. This paper critically examines the adequacy of using work-integrated learning (WIL) pedagogy for the purpose of entrepreneurship education. A novel approach is presented for achieving learning through entrepreneurship, referred to as supervised entrepreneurial work-integrated learning (sEWIL). The rationale and pedagogical considerations for sEWIL are discussed using a case study that is based on an internship-based entrepreneurship course offered at a major Canadian university. As part of the course, students learn about entrepreneurship through a combination of inclass experiential learning activities and a WIL component in the form of an internship with early-stage start-ups, which provide the work environment. Using formative and summative reflections, students critically examine their understanding and belonging to entrepreneurship, leading to personal growth and emerging self-awareness.\",\n",
       " \"Organic integration of ideological and political education and entrepreneurship education based on artificial neural network Entrepreneurship is a systematic project, and it needs entrepreneurial knowledge, skills, psychology and many other basic qualities. Therefore, it is imperative to educate college students on entrepreneurship. IPE (Ideological and political education) courses offered by universities should adhere to the spirit of the Chinese dream and integrate with 2E (Entrepreneurship Education), which will not only provide more theoretical guidance for college entrepreneurs in practice but also promote their practical experience to theoretical innovation and promote their all-round development. Therefore, this research is based on ANN (artificial neural network) to study the organic integration of IPE and entrepreneurship education. According to the practice of carrying out quality education in our university, a set of index systems suitable for comprehensive quality evaluation of students in engineering colleges is established. Use BPNN (BP neural network) method to construct the test model, and IL (Input layer) is responsible for receiving external input information. Through the learning rules in HL (Hidden layer), this paper refers to the weight values of various quality indicators, transforms the input values, and adjusts the deviation of test results. OL (Output layer) is responsible for outputting calculation results, that is, evaluating students' comprehensive quality information. The results of BPNN show that the actual value and the expected value are within a reasonable range, and the maximum relative error is 1.607 %, which meets the accuracy requirements. The established evaluation index system of 2E is reasonable and effectively reflects students' innovation and entrepreneurship abilities.\",\n",

This research explores teamwork competencies as a predictor of entrepreneurial team performance and the moderating effect of emerging cognitive and interpersonal team conflict as levers in entrepreneurship learning. Design/methodology/approach A time-lagged survey method was used to collect data from 49 teams (156 individuals) of undergraduate students in an experiential new venture creation course. A predictive model of entrepreneurial team performance through hierarchical regression analyses and moderated-moderation analyses was tested. Findings Results reveal that teamwork competencies have a significant and direct influence on entrepreneurial team performance and that intragroup conflict strengthens that relationship when high levels of cognitive conflict and low levels of interpersonal conflict emerge. Practical implications The findings have implications for the design of entrepreneurial training programs, which will benefit from interventions aimed at teamwork competency development that incorporate strategies promoting constructive cognitive conflict while preventing the emergence of interpersonal conflict. Originality/value This study is a step forward in entrepreneurship education research from the perspective of social and interpersonal processes by identifying the patterns of intra-team conflict that lead to more effective entrepreneurial teams and more productive use of teamwork competencies in a learning-by-doing entrepreneurial context.',\n",

       " 'The Surgery Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Program (SIEDP): An Experiential Learning Program for Surgery Faculty to Ideate and Implement Innovations in Health care OBJECTIVE: Surgeons are continually engaged in the incorporation of new technologies in their practice. In the operating room and beyond, they combine technical skill with creative problem solving to improve tools and techniques for patient care, making them natural innovators. However, despite their innovative tendencies, education on entrepreneurship and commercialization is severely lacking. Moreover, with increasing pressure to meet productivity metrics, their availability to learn the complexities of commercialization is limited. To address these challenges, we designed the Surgery Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Program (SIEDP) with the objective to advance faculty innovations, develop new departmental innovation initiatives, and improve faculty education in the area of innovation, entrepreneurship, and commercialization. DESIGN: The SIEDP is a first-of-its-kind experiential learning program specifically designed for busy clinical and research faculty in a major academic surgery department. Participants ideated and formed teams around health care innovations as they progressed through a 9 -month curriculum of expert guest lectures and interactive workshops. A postprogram evaluation and outcome tracking method was used to evaluate attainment of educational objectives and project development milestones. SETTING: The Department of Surgery, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan. PARTICIPANTS: Eleven surgery faculty of varying academic rank and surgical subspecialties. RESULTS: The program generated 2 faculty startup companies, 1 departmental commercial product, 3 patent disclosures, and 3 innovations that received additional funding. All participants in the program reported a significant increase in their understanding of innovation and entrepreneurship and that participation was a worthwhile faculty development activity. CONCLUSION: Despite the various challenges and time constraints of surgical practices, programs like SIEDP can educate surgeons and other academicians on innovation, entrepreneurship, and commercialization and add value to the academic mission of providing excellent education, research, and clinical care.

       " \"We hear everyday, 'this isn't me.' Navigating tensions and opportunities to translate interests toward entrepreneurial making Out-of-school time (OST) makerspaces are spaces for youth to engage in exploratory practices and deepen STEM interests in personally meaningful ways. Many youth-especially teens-additionally benefit from supportive relationships (e.g., caring adult mentors, peer mentors) in these spaces to help them uncover their interests and translate them into long-term trajectories of maker practice. Using a connected learning lens, this paper focuses on supportive adult relationships at a high school OST program (Sunrise of Philadelphia), and the ways in which practices around interest identification and development within its makerspace entrepreneurship program meaningfully impacted learning trajectories for youth by connecting them to new STEM opportunities, knowledge, and experiences. Through an illustrative case study, we present a portrait-of-practice that shows how OST educators facilitated brokering to connect youth to resources, mentoring, materials, and new communities that transcended their specific program. This manuscript contributes to known practices for translating youth interests in makerspaces, including incorporating youth voice and choice and making cultural connections to entrepreneurship opportunities. This case contributes to an understudied area of entrepreneurship education programs and activities that are needed in educational (K-12) makerspaces.\",\n",

In addition, higher education institutions (HEIs) are altering the form of student-lecturer and teaching-learning interaction, where DT restructures the bases of soft skills (SS). Since SS are difficult to measure, this study aims to analyze the bases of SS for digital academic entrepreneurship, responding to the following research question: What are the bases of digital academic entrepreneurship and how are they formed?Design/methodology/approach - An extensive integrative review of the literature revealed that due to the editable, re-combinable, reprogrammable and generating nature of digital technology, the basis of DT, it is necessary to develop SS in higher education students.Findings - The results show that the competencies can be developed considering three major groupings: (1) individual characteristics, (2) cultural characteristics and (3) knowledge sharing.Practical implications - Since SS are not easily taught, this study shows how the use of digital tools can help and support this type of process. It is suggested, therefore, that those in charge of HEIs should use the pillars presented in the framework proposed here to guide their institutions' strategic planning. With these pillars in mind, the aim is to stimulate an entrepreneurial mentality in students and develop digital academic entrepreneurship.Originality/value - An innovative conceptual model of digital academic entrepreneurship is proposed from the perspective of SS, where the interlinking of those groupings is permeated by DT, as well as the disruptive role of digital technology, leading to the development of an entrepreneurial mentality in HEI students.\",\n",

First, the theories of positive psychology were reviewed worldwide, and the current cultivation of entrepreneurial psychological quality for undergraduates was summarized. Second, undergraduates were taken as the survey objects. The questionnaires were distributed both online and offline to investigate the innovative entrepreneurship education (the IE education) in three different universities in Zhejiang Province, China. The current development of IE education in universities was summarized. Finally, according to the current educational status in universities, combining the Internet and maker education, the implementation strategies suitable for IE education in universities were proposed. According to the results of questionnaire survey, the proportion of college students who chose entrepreneurship was 6.1%. The innovation and entrepreneurship of contemporary college students was not optimistic, which was mainly related to the lack of systematic planning and teachers in China's current innovation and entrepreneurship education. Through the integration of Internet information technology and maker education, this study constructed a more systematic implementation scheme of innovation and entrepreneurship education in colleges and universities. It could meet the needs of students of different majors and grades. Meanwhile, teachers should give full play to the Students' subjective initiative and emphasize the student-centered learning style, thereby promoting the cultivation of students' innovative thinking. The IE education model of Internet + Maker Education in colleges can reform traditional college teaching methods and promote the cultivation of entrepreneurship, innovative thinking, and creative abilities, and the model can be used as a new idea and method for the development of IE education in universities.\",\n",

Design/methodology/approach - In total, 700 undergraduate students from a variety of majors at a large midwestern university in the USA were invited to take a web-based survey. They were asked to indicate which experiential activities they would participate/were participating in as part of their program. Findings - The findings show that students' entrepreneurial self-efficacy (ESE) is a driving force in classroom activities enhancing students' intentions. However, the authors also found that the type of classroom activities that are common in entrepreneurship education negatively impact students' ESE. Research limitations/implications - The generalizability is limited to the US region and the link from intention to behavior goes untested, but results strongly supported the adoption of social cognitive career theory to the entrepreneurship domain. Practical implications - This study lends support to the argument that promoting the learning process in entrepreneurship education should focus on real-world experience, action, and reflective processes to engage students in authentic learning, which should lead to greater entrepreneurial abilities and propensity, and eventually to enhanced entrepreneurial performance, which benefits individuals and societies. Social implications - This study suggests that the goals and pedagogical approaches to teaching entrepreneurship are issues that educators may need to revisit and update if the economic benefits of entrepreneurship are to be fully realized. Originality/value - While the relationship between entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurship activity is well documented in extant literature, this study found that activities that are common in entrepreneurship education may negatively impact students' ESE and need to be further explored.\",\n",

       " 'Causal propensity as an antecedent of entrepreneurial intentions The tourism sector is a sector with many opportunities for business development. Entrepreneurship in this sector promotes economic growth and job creation. Knowing how entrepreneurial intention develops facilitates its transformation into entrepreneurial behaviour. Entrepreneurial behaviour can adopt a causal logic, an effectual logic or a combination of both. Considering the causal logic, decision-making is done through prediction. In this way, entrepreneurs try to increase their market share by planning strategies and analysing possible deviations from their plans. Previous literature studies causal entrepreneurial behaviour, as well as variables such as creative innovation, proactive decisions and entrepreneurship training when the entrepreneur has already created his or her firm. However, there is an obvious gap at a stage prior to the start of entrepreneurial activity when the entrepreneurial intention is formed. This paper analyses how creativity, proactivity, entrepreneurship education and the propensity for causal behaviour influence entrepreneurial intentions. To achieve the research objective, we analysed a sample of 464 undergraduate tourism students from two universities in southern Spain. We used SmartPLS 3 software to apply a structural equation methodology to the measurement model composed of nine hypotheses. The results show, among other relationships, that causal propensity, entrepreneurship learning programmes and proactivity are antecedents of entrepreneurial intentions. These findings have implications for theory, as they fill a gap in the field of entrepreneurial intentions. Considering propensity towards causal behaviour before setting up the firm is unprecedented. Furthermore, the results of this study have practical implications for the design of public education policies and the promotion of business creation in the tourism sector. These policies should promote causal, proactive and creative behaviour in their entrepreneurship training. In this way, such policies would boost the entrepreneurial intention of individuals, which is an essential element to business creation.',\n",
       " \"An enterprise opportunity for entrepreneurial students Student enterprise development and experience assessed through the student voice Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of an experiential learning approach, available to students in all disciplines that combined a hands-on entrepreneurial and enterprise experience with professional consultant mentoring by using a competition to win business start-up funding. Design/methodology/approach - Students at a UK University had the chance to enter a competition in which they developed an entrepreneurial idea and then designed and presented a business plan to win business start-up capital. Students who were entrepreneurially motivated, but who lacked capital to start-up their business, were targeted, as these students have been argued to benefit the most from a combination of business plan training and entrepreneurial development. Feedback and data were obtained from the students at each stage of the process and was thematically analysed to assess the development of students' entrepreneurial skills and knowledge through the experience. Findings - The research found that the benefits gained from this approach included both enterprising and entrepreneurial skills, with the greatest impact being on student confidence and belief in their ability to start a business. The practical skills had a demystifying effect on students that made them feel like entrepreneurship and enterprise start-up were attainable. Research limitations/implications - The research focused on students at one UK University and centred on entrepreneurship in a retail business. The competition thus appealed mainly to students who were interested in retail start-up, thus leaving out some enterprising students whose feedback may have been different. In addition, while entrepreneurial skills are assessed in the data, the students who would be interested in the competition would be assumed to be proactive, and this skill was not able to be analysed. This research is a single case, and thus could be enhanced by more cases and looking at other enterprise start-up means beyond retail. Originality/value - This research makes a case that, in light of literature critical of the use of business plan training in entrepreneurship education, certain students are appropriate candidates for this approach. Specific skills and knowledge can be developed in university students using a live enterprise experience, supported by entrepreneurial mentoring. By making the event extracurricular, the study sought to capture the feedback of students who self-selected into the programme, who can benefit most from combined entrepreneurial and business plan development experience.\",\n",

Here, we describe an applied research program, the BioExperience Research and Entrepreneurship Challenge, launched in May 2020 to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on undergraduate experiential learning programs at the University of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The program provided undergraduates with meaningful talent and skills development opportunities by implementing a student-centred, project-based learning approach inspired by the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition. We present evidence from participant exit surveys suggesting that the program delivers a high-quality learning environment and improves learning outcomes compared to traditional work-integrated learning. Notably, 84% of respondents reported an excellent or exceptional learning experience and significant or profound improvements in skills, such as leadership (72% of respondents), problem-solving (42% of respondents) and research preparedness (52%) that are difficult to develop in conventional academic programs. Remarkably, 60% of respondents report that the job-readiness training provided by the program is better or much better than traditional work-integrated learning.

Research limitations/implications - A definition for VCP is tested empirically. These programs are shown to be sophisticated laboratory environments, allowing for clinical research towards the understanding of entrepreneurship and technology transfer processes. Practical implications - Findings identify practical benefits of combining entrepreneurship education and technology transfer activities, such as increased value creation through not only new firms, but also an entrepreneurially equipped graduate population. VCPs allow for spin-through of innovative ideas in the university environment, while simultaneously contributing to entrepreneurial learning. Originality/value - This paper presents findings from the first multiple case study into entrepreneurship education specifically designed to develop real-life venture as part of the core curriculum. Findings provide basis for investigating the value of integrating entrepreneurship education and technology transfer at the university.',\n",
       " 'NSF REU entrepreneurially minded applied energy program evaluation: traditional delivery versus alternative delivery (implemented during COVID-19) PurposeThe National Science Foundation (NSF) Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) programs are traditionally delivered in-person and full-time (40 h per week) for 10 weeks during the summer. However, this type of format has the potential to limit broader student participation. This study aims to compare learning assessment data between a traditional NSF REU (10 weeks of summer, full-time, in-person) to an alternative NSF REU delivered virtually, part-time and over 10 months as a result of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.Design/methodology/approachA retrospective pre-then-post survey was completed to assess perceived learning gains for each REU program. Three learning gains categories were assessed: entrepreneurial competencies, career goals and research skill development. T-tests were used to evaluate a difference in means between pre and post.FindingsFindings show the greatest quantity of learning gains within the alternative program delivery. Moreover, a larger quantity of learning gains was perceived within the first semester of the alternative program delivery compared to the second semester.Practical implicationsThe authors propose the NSF should be intentional about trying new approaches to REU programs delivery, including duration and format, as a way to broaden participation in engineering.Originality/valueThis study is original in that it is the first of its kind to assess an alternative REU program delivery (allowed only because of the COVID-19 pandemic) in comparison to traditional REU program delivery.',\n",

       " \"Intersections Between Entrepreneurial Minded Learning, Identity, and Motivation in Engineering A growing trend in engineering education is to infuse entrepreneurial minded learning (EML) into design-based courses across the curriculum. This educational approach supports students in developing an entrepreneurial mindset by the time they graduate and enter the workforce where such a mindset will be vital for their success. We posit that the infusion of EML in the first year of engineering education sets students on a trajectory to develop an entrepreneurial mindset by graduation, along with enhancing their motivations to succeed in the field and developing their identity as engineers. To investigate the impacts of EML, motivation, and identity, we surveyed first-and fourth-/fifth-year engineering students across five different institutions representing variation in academic setting, approach to EML, and maturity of their EML program. Through our multi-method analysis, we did not find evidence of major differences across the five institutions as we anticipated. However, we found noteworthy differences in the impact of one particular program at one site compared to the other sites, including higher average scores for all EML student outcomes at this site. We also found differences between male and female students and students in different educational years. We observed a positive relationship between EML and motivation across all sites. Based on our analysis, we believe the practice of using EML in engineering education holds promise for supporting students' success as engineers in the field. However, additional research into the nuances of EML experiences is needed to identify what makes them successful as our work did not show as many unique findings across sites as were anticipated. We attribute the lack of patterns to the variability between and within site EML implementation.\",\n",
       " \"Entrepreneurship education: Enhancing or discouraging graduate start-up at the University of Pretoria In-depth interviews were conducted with a sample of BCom Entrepreneurship graduates, as well as a control group to determine whether the exposure to entrepreneurship education can enhance actual business start-up. Information was collected on how they experienced the learning approaches, and the value which they had derived from the degree. This was done as a case study at the University of Pretoria. More entrepreneurship graduates started businesses than the control group. Findings of the various constraints to start-up - of the entrepreneurship graduates' group - focused on the lack of a viable business idea and know-how, as compared with the other graduate groups, who indicated that fear of failure and aversion to taking risks were their main constraints.

       " \"Entrepreneurship competencies in energy sustainability MOOCs Purpose Massive open online courses (MOOCs) have been gaining popularity as non-formal lifelong learning educational platforms. However, they have been criticized for their low completion rate and low ability for networking. The purpose of this paper is to analyze how incorporating entrepreneurial competencies in MOOCs develops attributes of educational innovation and collaborative projects. Design/methodology/approach The research followed a three-stage process: in first stage, a comprehensive literature review was conducted to identify dimensions of entrepreneurial skills and attributes of educational innovation in MOOCs. In the second stage, a quantitative study was carried out, based on the analysis of pre- and post-test surveys taken by a sample of 6,517 participants. In the last stage, the interaction analysis model/computer-mediated communication analysis model was applied through qualitative analysis, using the MAXQDA tool to identify if entrepreneurship opportunities were generated in the interactions within the discussion forums of the MOOCs. Findings The results show that the analyzed MOOCs have an overall completion rate of 12.55 per cent, above the average of the rates found in the literature review. However, only 14.29 per cent of the participants expressed at least one opportunity to generate ventures related to the topics of energy in the discussion forums. Practical implications - This research could help instructional designers and universities to consider the inclusion of entrepreneurship issues in the design of MOOCs' content and to encourage more activities that promote networking among participants, to identify business potential from the educational materials. Originality/value This research is one of the very few studies on entrepreneurship competencies in MOOCs to understand how the inclusion of issues related to entrepreneurship in MOOCs can generate a positive impact on participants.\",\n",

The study explored the influence of entrepreneurial factors as well as entrepreneurial learning experiences activities on the entrepreneurial intentions of Electronic Technology Education students in the universities. The study adopted a correlational survey research design. The population for the study was 366 Electronic Technology Education undergraduate students. There was no sampling as a result of the manageable size of the population. The students were surveyed by direct contact using questionnaire. They were asked to indicate the entrepreneurship learning experiences activities they were participating in/would participate in as part of their curriculum. Data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics and multiple regressions. The findings show that the more entrepreneurial activities students are engaged in, the less the influence of entrepreneurial factors on their entrepreneurial intentions and this significantly increased entrepreneurial intentions of students who prefer career choice as an entrepreneur. The findings also revealed that there is a positive relationship between gender, age, career choice, parents' occupation, and entrepreneurial intentions of Electronic Technology Education undergraduate students. It was recommended that Electronic Technology Education undergraduate students should see career options with a balance view in order to understand their abilities before deciding to venture in any electronic business enterprise.\",\n",
       " \"From I to We: collaboration in entrepreneurship education and learning? Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to ask: what effect does moving from individual to collective understandings of the entrepreneur in enterprising education have on the student's learning? And given this shift in understanding, is there a need for a new paradigm in entrepreneurship learning? Design/methodology/approach - This paper draws on ethnographic data from entrepreneurship education (EEd) at a summer school in Denmark. The purpose of the summer school was to bring the students from an awareness of their own competences to a shared understanding of resources, relationships and opportunities for becoming enterprising. Findings - Drawing on the recent developments in understanding creativity, the authors' explore the potential for similarities between becoming an entrepreneur in collaboration with others and being creative in collaboration with others. The authors' found that a focus on the collaborative and distributed character of entrepreneurship, as within the We-paradigm from creativity, does not exclude the importance of perceptions of individuals' self-images as part of a course in entrepreneurship. Yet, a reformulation of these could be an entry point for richer group work and articulation of diverse group potential. Research limitations/implications - This study suggests that it is possible to take at least one step further in what can be achieved during an EEd course. Rather than remain a focus on individual learning and treating group work a didactics instrument, team formation processes can be used as a pedagogy/andragogy experiential tool in the classroom with its own learning outcomes, as presented and discussed above. For educators, this means that they have an additional tool to aid the complicated task of bringing EEd to students across campus. For students, this new approach means that the often dreaded and frustrating process of classroom team formation can become a positive experience of purposeful team assembly and collaboration. Two possible limitations regarding the findings of this paper can be identified: for students with extensive experience in forming teams and working in groups, taking themthrough this process may not have the desired effect as they may rely on habits and known mechanism without much reflection; it may be difficult to achieve the desired effect with students that know each other well before the course starts, as they may have too strong hidden agendas about who they want to work with and who they do not want to work with that this will overpower the idea/opportunity/subject-matter driven approach (Aldrich and K im, 2007). Educators should consider if they may be subject to these limitations as this may have an effect on the use of active, opportunity-driven team formation in practise. To counter the second limitation, educators may want to consider how far into a course they want to facilitate the team formation; especially for courses running over significantly longer periods than two weeks. Future research may be able to assess the significance of these limitations. Practical implications - This paper explores how students experience and handle a shift from an individual to a collaborative understanding of entrepreneurship imposed on them by the novel and unique design of a course that explicitly incorporates the team formation process into the curriculum. This is undertaken to gauge the extent to which students experience this shift as fitting the actual and perceived need for shared practices in developing enterprising behaviour, and to shed light on what action/process-based EEd courses may benefit from actively including a team formation process in the course design. Social implications - EEd may be offered for a number of reasons. New enterprises are seen as a potential source of economic wealth and for the student, this type of education offers the possibility of using their knowledge in new ways, becoming entrepreneurs or intrapreneurs. Also, from the perspective of both the higher education institution and the student, in the fast changing world in which we live, the digital mobility and multiplicity of work environments requires a workforce that possesses a range of individual competences. Such as being persistent, engaged and having good ideas, competences that are difficult to teach and hard to learn. Adding to our knowledge of how to handle these concerns, the paper points at a number of social implications of EEd. Originality/value - The research conducted in this research paper contributes to the field of EEd by exemplifying how conceptual understandings of entrepreneurship as a collective enterprise, rather than an individual one, impact students' understanding and experience of entrepreneurship. Furthermore, it provides a foundation for expanding research aimed at providing students with a learning experience more in line with the everyday life of an entrepreneur.\",\n",

Design/methodology/approach - Sport education needs to focus on how it can overcome existing barriers to bring a more interdisciplinary approach. This paper uses entrepreneurship education theory to explore the changes required in sport education provision to create a more relevant and conducive teaching environment. Findings - The findings of this paper suggest that by bringing sport students into contact with entrepreneurship education, aids in the development of improved employability and social skills. Research limitations/implications - Introducing entrepreneurship education into sport will help the students develop learning initiatives that advance the scholarship of sport education within the university sector. Practical implications - The benefits of including entrepreneurship education in sport studies could be of interest to the directors of education wanting to increase student enrollments and interest in their courses. Originality/value - The study suggests ways to offer more interdisciplinary courses and activities linking entrepreneurship education to sport. This needs to be taken into consideration as it will enable the development of sport entrepreneurship education that improves links between academic research with policy and business initiatives.',\n",
       " \"You would expect the successful person to be the man Gendered symbolic violence in UK HE entrepreneurship education Purpose - This paper aims to to explore power and legitimacy in the entrepreneurship education classroom by using Pierre Bourdieu's sociological and educational theories. It highlights the pedagogic authority invested in educators and how this may be influenced by their assumptions about the nature of entrepreneurship. It questions the role of educators as disinterested experts, exploring how power and gendered legitimacy play out in staff-student relationships and female students' responses to this. Design/methodology/approach - A multiple-method, qualitative case study approach is taken, concentrating on a depth of focus in one UK's higher education institution (HEI) and on the experiences, attitudes and classroom practices of staff and students in that institution. The interviews, with an educator and two students, represent a self-contained story within the more complex story of the case study. Findings - The interviewees' conceptualization of entrepreneurship is underpinned by acceptance of gendered norms, and both students and staff misrecognize the masculinization of entrepreneurship discourses that they encounter as natural and unquestionable. This increases our understanding of symbolic violence as a theoretical construct that can have real-world consequences. Originality/value - The paper makes a number of theoretical and empirical contributions. It addresses an important gap in the literature, as educators and the impact of their attitudes and perceptions on teaching and learning are rarely subjects of inquiry. It also addresses gaps and silences in understandings of the gendered implications of HE entrepreneurship education more generally and how students respond to the institutional arbitration of wider cultural norms surrounding entrepreneurship. In doing so, it challenges assertions that Bourdieu's theories are too abstract to have any empirical value, by bridging the gap between symbolic violence as a theory and its manifestation in teaching and learning practices.\",\n",

THE EXPERIENCE OF THE FRESH START PROGRAMME This article considers the implications of migrant entrepreneurship education (MEEd) for sustainability and for the work of global adult educators. It will present some insights into the opportunities and challenges created by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through the experience of running the Fresh Start (FS) MEEd programme. This programme, funded by the European Union (EU) in 2017-2019, brought together teams from three countries - the Netherlands, the United Kingdom (UK) and Belgium - and involved three universities: Zuyd University of Applied Sciences (Maastricht), London South Bank University (LSBU); and University College Leuven Limburg (UCLL) in the province of Limburg, Belgium. The team found that there is no `one size fits all' as each context and each community have differing starting points and needs. Central to this is an approach which is learner-centred, enables participants' voices to be heard, and supports the co-creation of the programme. Education and learning are always a two-way process and migration offers us all an opportunity to learn from each other and to appreciate the rich resource of ideas and skills which migrants have to offer communities. The first section of the article provides an overview of the implications of migration for sustainability and its relationship to delivery of the SDGs. Section two examines the FS MEEd programme as a model for working with adult refugees and migrants. It presents some of the opportunities and challenges for educators created by the SDGs. Section three provides illustrations from the work of the FS MEEd programme and section four considers some implications and ways forward.\",\n",

The course was structured around the principles of constructive alignment and aimed to move beyond reflection on entrepreneurship towards action Design/methodology/approach - The course was delivered in alignment with intended learning outcomes, teaching and learning activities, and assessment. Along with lectures, group work and peer-review activities, students prepared a career development plan as the course progressed, undertook a homework assignment, wrote a reflective journal, and sat the GET2 test twice. Findings - Quantitative and qualitative analysis suggests that students developed more enterprising attitudes as result of participating in the course. This paper makes an argument in favour of entrepreneurship as a subject for all, a transformative experience capable of shaping the mindset in all who participate. Originality/value - This paper shows how a course on entrepreneurial education based on a through approach can be taught at a tertiary level in places other than economics faculties or business schools. Most tertiary courses rely on about and for approaches to entrepreneurial education, are teacher-centred, and follow a behaviouristic or cognitive learning paradigm of knowledge transmission, as opposed to the student-centred constructivist approach deployed and described here.',\n",

To promote the employment of college students and accelerate economic growth through entrepreneurial activities, the Chinese government and universities encourage the use of multiple inputs to boost holistic entrepreneurship education and training. This study aims to assesses the entrepreneurial competence of college students by analysing the effects of entrepreneurship education and policy implementation in China. Design/methodology/approach The quantitative approach considered a large sample of 12,269 students, who participated in entrepreneurship education in Chinese double-first-class universities, to construct a theoretical model of their entrepreneurial competence. Entrepreneurship competition was introduced as a mediating variable in this model. Findings This study revealed that college students develop entrepreneurial competence by participating in entrepreneurship competitions unlike students who participate in regular entrepreneurship education. Additionally, there was a significant difference in the measured impact of entrepreneurship policy between students who participated in entrepreneurship competitions and those who did not.

       " \"The empowering influence of applied colleges on entrepreneurial success in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia This study examines the transformative role that applied colleges play in fostering entrepreneurial performance. The study methodically surveyed 356 students currently enrolled in the Applied College of the University of Ha'il. Contrary to previous research, the findings reveal a crucial difference, suggesting that social class has an insignificant impact on entrepreneurial intentions, while self-confidence emerges as a paramount determinant. This disparity is due to the distinctive educational methodologies employed in applied colleges, including hands-on instruction, mentorship initiatives, workshops, and experiential learning opportunities, which collectively foster self-confidence. Notably, the survey results reveal a compelling statistic: 75% of female students in applied colleges demonstrate empowerment and cultivate entrepreneurial aspirations. The hands-on approach to entrepreneurship education empowers them to recognize their importance in the business landscape, thereby contributing to the improvement of Saudi Arabia's economic development. In addition, a remarkable 67.3% of students demonstrate a willingness to collaborate with peers of the opposite sex in entrepreneurial ventures, indicating a mature blend of social and economic acumen among applied university students. Furthermore, this study highlights the critical role of applied colleges in bridging the gap between theoretical academic knowledge and practical business acumen. By immersing students in authentic experiences and simulations that reflect the demands of the business world, applied colleges successfully equip them to address real-world business challenges, thereby mitigating potential pitfalls in commercial and agricultural projects.\",\n",

The teaching content of entrepreneurship education in colleges and universities is proposed. Since entrepreneurship education is practical, the auxiliary mechanism of entrepreneurship education also needs to be highly integrated with entrepreneurship practice. First, the network entrepreneurship teaching and management system is constructed, and students' entrepreneurial creativity, communication ability, leadership ability, and qualities are taken as the research object. Second, the traditional teaching method, case study method, and scene simulation method are used to analyze and discuss the influence of the entrepreneurial teaching mode, entrepreneurial experience, and entrepreneurial ability on students' entrepreneurial psychology. Finally, the questionnaire survey is used to conduct the relative sample t-test (Student's t-test), and the influence of three teaching methods on students' learning effects is analyzed. The influence of the three teaching methods on students' entrepreneurial psychological states is further analyzed by the statistical method. The experimental results show that the test result of the scene simulation method and the traditional teaching method is 0.584, the test result of the scene simulation method and the case study method is 0.842, and the test result of the case study method and the traditional teaching method is 0.595. This shows that the scene simulation method has a significant impact on students' entrepreneurial psychology and their entrepreneurial ability. In addition, students' cognition of professional status significantly affects their entrepreneurial psychology and attitudes, and the correlation coefficient is 0.576. Therefore, it is suggested that colleges and universities should adopt the scene simulation method to improve the teaching quality of entrepreneurship education and strengthen students' cognition of professional status and their entrepreneurial practice.\",\n",

       " 'Authentic Alignment - a new framework of entrepreneurship education Purpose - This paper seeks to address an underdeveloped aspect of entrepreneurship education (EE), which is still criticised for not explicitly linking educational practice with established educational theory. As such, the purpose of this paper is to propose a novel educational framework - Authentic Alignment - that the authors evolved based on their own EE practice, as well as two major educational theories. Design/methodology/approach - A review of a range of conceptual educational frameworks in EE revealed a gap in the current literature, referring to the fact that practice is not sufficiently linked to sound educational theory. The paper combines a range of educational theories - predominantly Constructive Alignment (CA) and Authenticity - to develop a novel conceptual framework, termed Authentic Alignment. The discussion of Authentic Alignment draws upon EE literature, as well as student feedback and the reflections and experiences of the practitioners and academics involved in delivering a higher education unit underpinned by Authentic Alignment. Findings - It is argued that Authentic Alignment coherently and explicitly links educational practice to major established educational theories and as such presents a valuable approach to education through entrepreneurship as it aligns authentic approaches to instruction, learning and assessment that strike a balance between resembling and being relevant for real entrepreneurial activity. Practical implications - The paper invites educators to draw upon Authentic Alignment for their own entrepreneurship units/programmes by customising the specific approaches to their own requirements, while retaining the underlying principle of constructively aligned authentic education. Originality/value - By explicitly linking EE to CA and Authenticity, this paper introduces a novel educational framework that provides a valuable structure for education through entrepreneurship. The customisability of Authentic Alignment, however, suggests a wider applicability and is thus valuable also for education about and for entrepreneurship.',\n",

Despite the fact that students gain domain knowledge through higher education, many organisations report that freshmen have a severe lack of collaborative skills. These skills are essential for today's graduates to compete in the world of tomorrow. Collaborative learning is a set of strategies that help the students achieve management skills in an effective way, leading to deeper learning. It increases the critical thinking level, communication, leadership, and employability skills, as well as responsibility, and prepares the students for real-life social and economic environments. As collaborative learning practises are so important, this study focuses on assessing the impact they have on competency development, specifically in entrepreneurship programs. A qualitative and quantitative survey has been administered to 536 students pursuing higher education in management in India's Delhi and the NCR region. A questionnaire has been prepared with 20 questions, comprising 15 closed-ended and 5 open-ended questions. With the results obtained from the survey, it is clear that the collaborative learning practise has a positive relationship with the entrepreneurship programme and competence development among students. The result proved that collaborative learning does benefit the students more in developing competency than individual learning through cultivating essential skills such as communication, teamwork, critical thinking, and responsibility.\",\n",
       " \"A case study on technology entrepreneurship education at a Taiwanese research university Technology-based entrepreneurship education has recently been promoted in Taiwan. The promotion is based on the notion of how technology can enhance economic growth and innovation. The impact of educational programs on entrepreneurial intentions and learning, however, is an issue of discussion. This paper presents a case study of a technology-based entrepreneurship course at a Taiwanese research university. The study aims to investigate how the course aligns with the students' learning experiences. To this end, a qualitative research approach is utilized whereby interviews, focus group discussions, and class material are the main data sources. The findings suggest the difficulty in setting appropriate goals with technology-based entrepreneurship courses. Expectedly, it is difficult to achieve quick technology commercialization results due to the students' inexperience, short course lengths, and the (often) technological immatureness. Goals, such as interdisciplinary and reflective learning, understanding the entrepreneurial processes, and fostering entrepreneurial mindsets, should therefore be emphasized more. However, as the study is based on the findings of a single educational course, it is limited in its generalizability. Nonetheless, it offers an example of the merits and challenges with entrepreneurship education in Taiwan. As such, it provides suggestions for educational and policy action which would go beyond the researched course. (C) 2017 College of Management, National Cheng Kung University.

Interactions between internal and external causes of failure and learning from entrepreneurial failure are also investigated, as well as entrepreneurs' aspects (i.e. age, experience and education) and organisational contextual factors (i.e. size, sector and location).Design/methodology/approachThis study employed a hypothetico-deductive approach through a survey of 250 purposively sampled entrepreneurs who had suffered business failures. The survey data were subjected to regression analysis and moderated regression using WarpPLS software and an independent sample t test for an in-depth analysis.FindingsThe results indicated that learning from entrepreneurial failure positively affected business performance, an effect moderated by the type of failure, particularly with large failures. Only perceived internal causes of failure exerted a positive effect on learning from entrepreneurial failure; the external causes did not. The effect of failure on business performance was stronger on entrepreneurs who were older and experienced, had non-university educations and operated small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) outside Java-Bali islands.Originality/valueThis study's findings provide empirical evidence that supports the experiential learning theory and attribution theory in explaining the interaction between learning and failure, its cause, its consequences and its magnitude as perceived by entrepreneurs of SMEs in Indonesia, where the rate of failure is relatively high.

       " \"Imitation and entrepreneurial learning: Insights from academic spin-offs The subject of this article is the inheritance of the parent university of academic spin-offs through imitation and entrepreneurial learning. Building on a capability perspective, the article adds to the literature on university spin-offs and presents insights into the academic spin-off phenomenon that may be useful in supporting academic entrepreneurship. The study is based on four universities, all located in the metropolitan area of Milan. The authors followed the start-up processes of 74 spin-off ventures over the period 2004-2013, obtaining economic data for 61 of the ventures. The analysis we carried out shows that parent universities influence the industry distribution of spin-offs, since most spin-offs showing a positive performance were concentrated in industries that (1) could benefit from the most advanced research of the parent university and (2) were those in which previous start-ups had also tended to concentrate. Thus, a focus on the parent (university)-progeny (spin-off) dyad as the unit of analysis reveals that the specific capabilities available and previous spin-off experience developed in the university play an important role in facilitating spin-off ventures and influencing new firms' behaviour in their start-up and development phases.\",\n",

       " 'Influence of early exposure to family business experience on developing entrepreneurs Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to consider the influences of family business and exposure to family business ideas upon students and graduates during their transition from higher education (HE) towards career identification of entrepreneurship. It explores influences, values and experiences actively impacting on business start-up following exposure to family business or business ideas. Design/methodology/approach - A grounded theory approach was adopted to investigate the wider student/graduate transition between HE and business start-up support provision. The aim of the interviews undertaken was to investigate those influences actively impacting on business start-up provision and reflect upon the complexities within the student journey through transition towards business start-up. The researchers investigated stories, experiences and insights of nascent and practicing entrepreneurs acquiring rich qualitative evidence. Findings - This study evaluates the influences impacting upon practicing entrepreneurs following exposure to family business and awareness of business ideas arising from immediate or extended family prior to undertaking a business start-up. The findings inform discussions about family role models and contribute to the development of enterprise education pedagogy. It is found that individuals attachment to business and family business values are strongly formed concepts that motivate and steer entrepreneurial direction. Practical implications - This paper contributes to development of enterprise and entrepreneurship educator pedagogy and explores use of entrepreneurial role models and positive learning experiences gained through personal exposure to family business and ideas. Originality/value - This study contributes to a fuller understanding of the potential for positive influence through exposure to familial businesses, growing up around businesses and awareness of business ideas arising from immediate or extended family. Integration of learning opportunities with development of pedagogy will be of interest to the enterprise education community.',\n",

We report on the findings of an inductive case study of corporate entrepreneurship training in a large multinational corporation. We explore the learning outcomes which participants experienced, and outline how an action learning approach enabled these learning outcomes. Our emergent model of corporate entrepreneurship training is based on an episodic view of training, recognizing that individual, group and situational influences, need to be considered if a more complete understanding of what makes for effective training in this domain is to be developed.',\n",
       " 'The mediating effects of social entrepreneurial antecedents on the relationship between prior experience and social entrepreneurial intent: The case of Filipino and Indonesian university students Purpose The paper aims to investigate how the social entrepreneurial intention antecedents directly and indirectly affect social entrepreneurial intent. The participants of the study were Filipino and Indonesian university students from selected higher education institutions (HEIs). Design/methodology/approach A quantitative research design was used and partial least square-structural equation modeling was used to measure the direct and indirect effects of the structural model. Findings The results revealed that prior experience with social problems positively and significantly affects empathy, moral obligation, social entrepreneurial self-efficacy and perceived social support. Moreover, it was also found that social entrepreneurial self-efficacy and perceived social support positively and significantly affect social entrepreneurial intent, and these two antecedents mediate the positive relationship between prior experience with social problems and social entrepreneurial intent. Research limitations/implications As the present study only examined social entrepreneurial intentions among Filipino and Indonesian university students, other researchers may test the framework in another locale. Others may find interest in identifying the significant difference in social entrepreneurial intent among between or among nations. Practical implications The findings of the present study can benefit HEIs in terms of offering social entrepreneurship programs and courses. The role of HEIs is truly important. Providing an avenue for students for them to be socially entrepreneurial and empowering them to be future social entrepreneurs can truly help in sustainably promoting social entrepreneurship. These can be done by designing relevant learning materials and requirements that will permit students to be social venture creators. Social implications Based on this study, if these students were exposed to social entrepreneurship activities during their university life (prior experience), then the propensity for them to be social venture creators in high. With the myriad problems in the Philippines and Indonesia, exposure to social problems is evident. Through proper inculcation of social entrepreneurial spirit, Filipino and Indonesian students will greatly create massive impact in the landscape of Asian social entrepreneurship. Originality/value The present study offers a new perspective on social entrepreneurial intentions, as it is in Asian setting. It also provides a viewpoint where only social entrepreneurial self-efficacy and perceived social support positively affect social entrepreneurial intent and, at the same time, act as mediators between prior experience with social problem and social entrepreneurial intent. With these results, it enriches the theoretical foundations of social entrepreneurship.',\n",
       " \"TOWARDS A BROADER CONCEPTION OF ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNALISM EDUCATION Starting with everyday practice In this article we examine the impact of entrepreneurialism on postgraduate students of journalism at Aarhus University in Denmark. We specifically focus on a course module that students follow while undertaking a full-time internship in the media and communication industry. The module requires students to use their internship to identify opportunities for innovation, to devise innovative solutions and, where possible, to present and implement solutions. Drawing on focus group interviews and assignments, we explore how students experienced learning entrepreneurship and innovation whilst being immersed in communities of practice. The places of internship functioned as anchors for the students' entrepreneurship processes by providing access to a wide range of opportunities for development and a real-life arena for testing their own entreprenurial skills. Yet, even in this environment students did not necessarily develop a strong entrepreneurial identity. Instead, they felt the module content on entrepreneurialism made them look at their places of internship in a more critical way. Moreover, it provided them with skills for innovation and entrepreneurship that would be useful in the future.\",\n",

       " 'Breaking the waves: Routines and rituals in entrepreneurship education Learning is related to the environment created for the learning experience. This environment is often highly routinized and involves a certain social structure, but in entrepreneurship education, such routinization and structure may actually counteract the learning goals. This article investigates how classroom routines and rituals impact on entrepreneurship education in order to problematize how existing classroom environments may hinder critical learning experiences from taking place. This article builds on extensive insights from six cohorts of students at two Scandinavian universities over a 4-year period (2012-2015). The data were procured using an experiential-explorative research approach in which the researchers were personally involved in reflective processes as co-learners. The findings illustrate how educators can use rituals actively to change how students learn. However, students are very wary of embracing new structures and rituals; indeed, some feel so comfortable with the old rituals that they would prefer not to change from being receivers of knowledge to co-creators of the learning situation. It is therefore important to exchange existing rituals with new ones that enhance the feeling of safety and involve the students in creating the change. This is achieved through scaffolding and setting up ritual markers, which are continuously repeated.',\n",
       " 'Fostering Agribusiness Entrepreneurship for Kenyan Youth through Practice-Based Education Approximately 1 million Kenyan youth enter the labour market each year, a number which the formal sector has been incapable of absorbing. As a result, youth unemployment and underemployment rates are high, with two-thirds of youth aged 15-24 not engaged in the labour force. The lack of formal wage opportunities pushes these young people into entrepreneurial activities; however, due to the theoretical focus of the current education system, many secondary school-leavers do not possess the practice-based skills to start their own businesses. This article argues for building partnerships between secondary schools, largely in rural areas, and agribusinesses to foster skills-building that will enable young people to start entrepreneurial activities in the agricultural sector. It draws on interviews with agribusiness owners and stakeholders in the education sector, and survey data from secondary school students and on youth employment to identify how to improve youth employability through business-led experiential programmes.',\n",

While there is an emerging body of research that promotes enterprising or entrepreneurial skills as necessary to secure viable and sustainable careers in the creative industries, the inclusion of these areas in tertiary programs remains contested. To explore the extent to which a greater focus on these skills is necessary in undergraduate curricula, completed surveys were obtained from a sample of ninety-eight graduates from regional north-eastern Australia in order to gain insights into their employment experiences and reflections on their learning. The findings reveal a number of insights into the experiences and realities for graduates in terms of employment in the creative industries, including the challenges some face in securing employment in their preferred area of practice, as well as reflections on a number of enterprising or entrepreneurial skills argued to be missing from their learning. The findings provide further evidence of the demonstrated need for higher education curricula to focus more significantly on enterprising or entrepreneurial skills, in order to better equip graduates for potential employment success in the creative industries.',\n",

The case of the master's degree in Entrepreneurial Innovation Management, set up jointly by the University of Salerno and the Universidad Catolica de Pereira, is presented. Design/methodology/approach In order to conduct a competitive market analysis, the latest data on master's degrees in economics and information technologies management have been collected by means of a scraping procedure in order to build a data set for analysis. The authors have considered the masters' degrees offered in Bogota, where most universities of Colombia are located. Findings The data point out that current master's degree courses do not recognize the importance of interdisciplinary training, which is in great demand in the world of work: economics and computer science never run together and rarely do universities collaborate within a network to set up joint programs. Practical implications - The entrepreneurial culture could yield economic and social benefits by training students for a dynamic, global and increasingly digital job market. The case study represents a first step in building a network, which could be extended to other countries in the future. Originality/value The originality of the study lies in the proposal of a joint Italy-Colombia master's degree, which is set up within a higher education network and may prove useful in creating job opportunities in both countries involved.

However, few research studies have examined the practices and beliefs of instructors in these programs. Understanding these beliefs will help the development of pedagogical and theoretical models to drive entrepreneurship education. The purpose of this paper is to gather information on instructors' beliefs and teaching practices relating to engineering entrepreneurship education. Three research questions were addressed in the study: 1) How do faculty members define the entrepreneurial mindset? 2) Do faculty members believe that the entrepreneurial mindset is something that can be developed? 3) How do faculty members teach entrepreneurship; is there a relationship between their teaching practices and their beliefs? The study was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, twenty-six instructors of entrepreneurship participated in an in-depth structured interview focusing on their perceptions of entrepreneurship education. The results of this study led to the construction of an online survey that was administered to 37 instructors at three institutions in the second phase of the study. Results showed that faculty tended to believe that the entrepreneurial mindset is a function of both innate characteristics and skills that can be built through instruction. Faculty also felt that entrepreneurship programs should focus on venture and be taught through formal programs. The participants advocated for the use of experiential learning for teaching entrepreneurship.\",\n",

To learn this unique combination, social entrepreneurship education plays a vital role. It positively influences the entrepreneurial intentions of the students. Previously this education was limited to the realm of business studies, but more recently social entrepreneurship education is encompassing students from different disciplinary backgrounds. The present study aims to highlight the learning experiences of the Sociology students during Social Entrepreneurship. Thematic analysis of the textual reflective papers was conducted to highlight different aspects of their learning experiences. The students were motivated to study the course majorly because of their experience with the instructor. Financial motivations were a main driver towards the selection of the course because social entrepreneurship was viewed as a lucrative alternative owing to the rising unemployment in the country. The students highlighted that experiential learning is indispensable to social entrepreneurship education which was severely affected due to the Covid-19 pandemic as the transition towards online education took place. Gender played a significant role in the motivation and inspiration gained from the course as most female students perceived social entrepreneurship education to be a path towards financial independence. Social entrepreneurship education is a growing filed in Pakistan and the higher educational institutes must take into account the learning experiences of students with different disciplinary backgrounds to enhance the overall entrepreneurial capacity of students by overcoming the barriers that they face. The current study presents insights for the growth of social entrepreneurship education in Pakistan.',\n",

This article seeks to develop and empirically measure the entrepreneurial process competence in the context of EE. A self-assessment questionnaire based on the 'generic' entrepreneurship competence model, improved with the section on entrepreneurial process competence, was used to assess the impact of EE intervention in major Estonian universities. The survey took place in two stages: the same questions were repeated at the beginning and end of the course in the 2019 autumn semester. It gave the responses of 355 students and showed the varied and small positive individual-level impact of entrepreneurship courses on minor aspects of 'generic' competences in different universities, depending on training methodology, study volume and contact hours. At the same time, all the competencies of the entrepreneurial process grew significantly. Readiness to start own business did not change.

This raises the question of how educators can introduce AI technologies to undergraduate business students while also developing their higher-order thinking skills and preparing them for the complex challenges facing today's business leaders. At the same time, we have also witnessed a growing interest in social entrepreneurship among our student population. To address both needs, we designed and implemented the Innovation Farm, a gamified social entrepreneurship startup project, to help students learn the concepts and applications of AI in an introductory management information systems (MIS) course. The students work in teams to propose AI-powered products and services targeting real-world social issues. The project cultivates social awareness and empathy in students, fosters innovation, and introduces them to current AI technologies while also reinforcing their understanding of MIS course content. Students found the gamified approach engaging, as they are tackling real-world social issues while also learning about innovation, collaboration, branding, and fundraising for a social startup. Students reported positive outcomes related to innovating using technology, making an impact through real-world projects, and practicing their teamwork and leadership skills.\",\n",

Just as all forms before it, online learning has experienced implicit biases. With the abrupt lockdowns mandated by governments across the world, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many educational institutions were thrust into an online learning environment with similarities and differences to the established online institutions already in place. Educational systems were forced to prepare and install methods of communication and instruction by using online resources such as online video calls and discussion forums. Here, we assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Pre-Capstone Innovation Experience course at New York University, which provides entrepreneurship education in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) for undergraduates. Assessments captured between 2017 and 2020 from Pre-Capstone Innovation Experience participants demonstrate the gendered impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the learning of undergraduate students.',\n",

The aim of the paper is to analyse the kind of written assignment, which was applied in three entrepreneurship courses in higher education, and to examine how this kind of assignment shaped and was shaped by students' information seeking. Method. The study is based on an empirical material consisting of twenty-two written assignments from the particular courses. The material was contextualized by participatory observations of teaching activities and documents from two of these courses. Analysis. A socio-cultural perspective is used to analyse the relation between the particular courses' learning objectives, the written assignments and the assignments' description of students' information seeking. Results. The students used information from the chosen sources as well as from the collected material to get inspiration for developing a project idea, refine it and justify it. In this way, information seeking and sharing supported both generation and stabilization of ideas as potential existing objects. Conclusion. The investigation of written assignments from the entrepreneurship courses indicates that a certain variation of information activities formed part of the learning process and in this way influenced the particular course practice. However, there is a need of further examination of students' searching approach in this kind of courses.\",\n",

However, we do not know much about the role of universities in preparing the next generation of graduates for such challenges. To address this gap, in this paper we investigate the extent to which entrepreneurial learning at university contributes to students' career intentions to work for small rather than larger firms. Additionally, we consider the role of the family context and investigate how the university's influence on students' career intentions is moderated by students' exposure to entrepreneurship in their family. Using data from 155,358 students, we find that entrepreneurial learning at university is negatively associated with the preference to work for small firms compared to larger firms and that this effect is even more pronounced for students with enterprising family background, particularly those who have shares in their parents' company.

Therefore, a case study strategy is employed which concentrates on the most important business schools from the European Union member states; thus, 267 syllabuses from 21 higher education institutions are identified and analyzed. The results prove that European business schools manage to develop most of the required entrepreneurial skills among their students. Their graduates are both task and people oriented. On the one hand, they value performance, are capable of solving problems and taking calculated risks. On the other hand, they know how to communicate and collaborate within a team. Besides, it may be stated that the analyzed educational programs are combining the about entrepreneurship approach with for entrepreneurship perspective; they focus on developing cognitive, functional, and behavioral competences by combining lectures with active learning techniques. These actions are influenced by cultural specificity and have an impact on a country's capacity to be a top performer, in terms of entrepreneurship development. These findings have both theoretical and practical implications. On a theoretical level, they extend the literature regarding the development of entrepreneurial skills by providing concrete information about the skills on which the academic curricula focus.

EEPs are degree programmes designed to provide mastery and experience over several years of academic study. Structural equation modelling on survey data gathered from 348 graduating students from eight universities in Pakistan showed how three EEP components (learning, inspiration and resources) influence intention: learning and inspiration activities both increase perceived norms for being an entrepreneur and students' perceptions that they can be entrepreneurs (perceived control). Access to incubation resources had the strongest effect on intention by increasing perceived norms which in turn increases positive attitudes and perceived control.

Specifically, this paper aims to introduce education for sustainable entrepreneurship into the integrated model, thereby fitting the model into the context of sustainable entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach Data was gathered with the help of a structured questionnaire from 435 students of a university in Nigeria. The students passed through a special entrepreneurship training in which they were educated on the concept and practice of sustainable entrepreneurship. SmartPLS was used to test the proposed structural model. Findings The findings revealed that education for sustainable entrepreneurship significantly influences all variables of the integrated model, but has nonsignificant direct influence on sustainable entrepreneurial intention. Sustainable entrepreneurial intention is significantly driven by attitude and propensity to act. Therefore, the inclusion of education for sustainable entrepreneurship into the regression equation adds to its explanatory power. Originality/value This study contributes toward understanding of sustainable entrepreneurial intention of intermediate university students in a developing world context - Nigeria.

The findings indicate that organizing programmes that educate the campus community can open up the minds of the students and staff to the potential of recycling initiatives, increase their knowledge and awareness, and encourage innovation and creative thinking in the use of recycled materials. By applying the values of entrepreneurship, the staffs and students can generate income, and improve the preservation and beautification of the campus. However, challenges faced by the recycling entrepreneurs are: stealing of recycling items, recycling is considered as a non-glamorous job, lack of materials because the community is not practicing separation of garbage, lack of capital to expand and purchase the equipment due to lack of support from financial institutions.',\n",
       " \"Promoting UAE entrepreneurs using E-STEM model Although students' STEM designs are widely admired by teachers, relatively little attention has been given to making use of these designs by incorporating a basic understanding of the market to create new values for communities. The E-STEM model was developed to promote entrepreneurial practices into STEM disciplines and prepare students for the market. Yet, little is explored regarding the teaching pedagogy of E-STEM model and its outcomes. A qualitative case study was conducted to explore E-STEM experiences of high school students and to further explore teachers' perceptions regarding the teaching approach of E-STEM model. A total of twelve teachers were trained to understand the concept of E-STEM, and five of them were selected purposefully to implement E-STEM model with 42 students. Through analyzing and interpreting students' projects and teachers' interview transcripts, this study concluded that the effective practices of E-STEM model require a development-oriented instruction to enhance students' outcomes over time.\",\n",
       " 'Promoting interdisciplinarity through an intensive entrepreneurship education post-graduate workshop Purpose - While creativity and innovation are found within many disciplines, the opportunity to develop a tangible skill set and share ideas with contemporaries can be limited within the siloed structure of many tertiary institutions. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate a model that addresses the pedagogical challenge of interdisciplinary learning. Design/methodology/approach - This paper adopts a case-based approach. The case subject is Aalborg University that founded an intensive entrepreneurial education workshop that incorporates a problem-based learning (PBL) approach. This paper evaluates the program design, development, and replication plus compares the motives and subsequent experiences between workshop participants in Denmark and Australia. Findings - The findings of this case study validate the centrality of entrepreneurship education as a discipline which has the capacity to unite staff and students approaching problems from various fields. The workshop design was adapted to the changing needs and expectations of staff and students and was successfully replicated overseas. Originality/value - Denmark established an innovative, intensive workshop which seized the opportunity to deliver an engaging program that unlocks untapped creative potential among students from diverse cultures and multiple disciplines. Overall, this research contributes toward the body of knowledge examining student engagement and the delivery of PBL activities within an interdisciplinary learning environment.',\n",
       " \"Unintentional teaching of entrepreneurial competences Research on entrepreneurship education (EE) emphasizes the role of learning environments, contexts and pedagogical choices in developing students' entrepreneurial competences. EE has assumed that it solely carries the task of improving entrepreneurial competences. Yet, the objectives, content and methods of teaching vary, and hence non-entrepreneurship teachers' classrooms can also provide a learning environment for entrepreneurial competences. However, whether or not this kind of unintentional teaching of entrepreneurial competences takes place has not been widely addressed. In this study, the authors investigate how business school non-entrepreneurship teachers' teaching methods unintentionally match the known framework of entrepreneurial competences. The findings indicate that non-entrepreneurship teachers do unintentionally expose their students to entrepreneurial competences such as creativity, learning from experience and financial literacy. However, competences such as opportunity recognition, perseverance and mobilizing resources do not receive similar attention. The findings indicate that some entrepreneurial competences are not solely owned by EE, but can be embedded in non-entrepreneurship education. Accordingly, the study extends the current understanding of EE and which niche competences should be emphasized in it, but also demonstrates how non-entrepreneurship teachers can expose students to entrepreneurial competences while teaching in their own subject areas.\",\n",
       " 'Entrepreneurship education research in Nigeria: current foci and future research agendas Purpose Entrepreneurship education plays a crucial role in the development of entrepreneurs and the enhancement of entrepreneurial activities in every economy. This paper presents the findings of a review of Nigerian entrepreneurship education literature published in 20 journals over a 16-year period. The purpose of this paper is to examine research contributions in the field of entrepreneurship education within the Nigerian context, with the aim of understanding the focus and the different research areas covered by researchers in this area, and to make suggestions that can guide scholars in their future research contributions. Design/methodology/approach Systematic literature reviews are recognized methods for conducting evidence-based research. The study adopted a systematic literature review approach, drawing from a computerized search of five selected databases, using predetermined key words by the researchers. Findings The main finding of this paper is that related concepts like skills, intention, drive and attitude have been used in expounding discussions on the outcome of entrepreneurship education, but very little has been written on entrepreneurial mindset, which other studies have suggested is a crucial point in the journey of an entrepreneur (Reed and Stoltz, 2011; Neneh, 2012). Furthermore, learning and teaching of entrepreneurship in the Nigerian higher education institutions seem to be more focused on creating awareness about entrepreneurship, as against the experiential approach that scholars have argued to be a prerequisite for developing the next generation of entrepreneurs (Bell, 2015). The study also found that over 80 percent of the reviewed articles are published in journals not ranked or indexed in the ABS journal rankings or the Scopus database. Research limitations/implications The paper is limited since it is based on a review of literature from a selected range of databases, covering a specific time span. This potentially excludes other studies outside this time span. Scholarship in this area and context will benefit greatly when researchers target, choose and engage the higher ranked and more impactful journals as the outlet for their research outputs. Practical implications At a time when efforts are being made to address socioeconomic issues like poverty and unemployment through mainstream training in entrepreneurship education, this paper provides a better understanding of the state of research in this context, by highlighting the potential gaps as to where research investigation is needed for better policy formulation and guiding future research. Originality/value There are limited studies that focus on the issue of entrepreneurial mindset in entrepreneurship education in Nigeria. Overall, this paper identifies an important gap in the literature that warrants future research.',\n",
       " 'EFFECTIVENESS OF TYPOLOGY AND LEARNING ENVIRONMENT IN DEVELOPING ENTREPRENEURIAL COMPETENCIES: A COMPARATIVE STUDY The introduction of entrepreneurship course as a core module in higher education institutions (HEIs) under the Malaysia Education Blueprint (MEB) 2015-2025 has not increased entrepreneurship initiatives. This is partly attributed to ineffective implementation of entrepreneurship skills in the HEI curriculum. Although attempts were made to delineate the central phenomena of entrepreneurship learning to develop entrepreneurial competencies and intention, there was no consistent outcome. This comparative study used empirical data to investigate the contribution of multidisciplinary learning environment and the use of Through methodology as an entrepreneurial education pedagogy to develop entrepreneurial competencies and intention among students. A two-phase stratified single-stage cluster sampling approach was adopted that involved stratifying the entire population of 260 second-year degree students into learning environment strata and partitioning the strata into mutually exclusive entrepreneurial education pedagogy clusters. Data was collected from every single subject within the clusters. Descriptive analytical statistics was used in gauging the effectiveness of the research learning environment and typology pedagogy. The findings revealed that even though entrepreneurial intention remains a challenge, multidisciplinary learning environment that involves students from different disciplinary programs doing entrepreneurial ventures such as experiential learning and taking calculated business risks are most effective in inculcating entrepreneurial competencies. This study has shown that having the appropriate learning environment and typology pedagogy, including consideration of the psychological appeal of students are essential in nurturing entrepreneurial competencies among students. The outcome of this study provides a better understanding for both, HEI academicians and the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) in making entrepreneurship learning more relevant to produce students with entrepreneurial competencies.',\n",
       " \"Examining the Impact of a Gamified Entrepreneurship Education Framework in Higher Education Entrepreneurship education constitutes a top priority in policy agendas across the globe as a means to promote economic growth, fight unemployment and create social capital. An important premise of entrepreneurship education is that it can be learned and students can be taught to formulate entrepreneurial mentality, skills and competencies, something that can result in the formulation of startups and business initiatives. Given the importance of entrepreneurship, the necessity to formulate efficient entrepreneurship education frameworks and training programs arise. In this work, we present the design of an entrepreneurship educational environment that is based on learning in 3D virtual worlds. Innovative 3D virtual reality technologies were utilized to provide immersive and efficient learning activities. Various topics of entrepreneurship education courses were designed and formulated to offer students the opportunity to obtain theoretical knowledge of entrepreneurship. The 3D virtual reality educational environment utilizes pedagogical approaches that are based on gamification principles, allowing students to study in immersive ways as well as in game-based learning activities on real challenges that can be found in business environments. The game-based learning activities can help students gain necessary skills, helping them to tackle everyday obstacles on their entrepreneurial pathways. An experimental study was performed to explore the learning efficiency of the environment and the gamified learning activities as well as assess their learning impact on student's motivation, attitude, and overall learning experience. The evaluation study revealed that the framework offers efficient gamified learning activities that increase students' motivation and assist in the formulation of entrepreneurship mentality, skills and competencies.\",\n",
       " \"Personalizing Entrepreneurial Learning: A Pedagogy for Facilitating the Know Why As the global diffusion of entrepreneurship education continues, along with increasing investment in, and expectations of, educational initiatives, it has become important to articulate what we are teaching and why, along with the specifics of where, how, and to whom. Yet, despite a growing consensus about what constitute the entrepreneurial activities and competencies required to start a new venture, there has been little agreement regarding the content of entrepreneurship education, or how learning should be delivered (Bygrave 2007, The Handbook of Qualitative Research Methods in Entrepreneurship, 17-48.

Education_Training 52 (1): 20-47). Clearly, the purpose of any education, the why for the teacher, shapes the content, the what, and the method, the how. But what about the personal how and why for the learner? Sarasvathy's theory of effectuation (Sarasvathy 2001, Causation and effectuation: Toward a theoretical shift from economic inevitability to entrepreneurial contingency. Academy of Management Review 26(2): 24363; 2008, New Horizons in Entrepreneurship, Cheltenham: Edward Elgar) has led educators to consider how an entrepreneur's personal resources and resourcefulness can and should alter their how. Scholars are now sharing pedagogical approaches for motivating that type of learning (Fletcher and Watson 2007, Entrepreneurship, Management Learning and Negotiated Narratives: 'Making it Otherwise for Us-Otherwise for Them'. Management Learning 38(1): 9-26; Gibb 2011, Concepts into practice: meeting the challenge of development of entrepreneurship educators around an innovative paradigm-the case of the International Entrepreneurship Educators' Programme (IEEP).

International Journal of Entrepreneurship and Innovation Management 13(2): 161-78). However, little research has addressed the personal why for the entrepreneurial learner (Rae 2005, Entrepreneurial Learning: A Narrative-Based Conceptual Model.

Education + Training 54 (4): 319-329). In this paper, we seek to fill this gap by exploring how entrepreneurship educators can facilitate the personalized learning to develop the Know Why for nascent entrepreneurs in the process of becoming entrepreneurial. We combine theories of entrepreneurship practice, education, and learning to propose a model for entrepreneurial Know Why. We utilize a case study of an entrepreneurship program applying a learning-through-venture-creation approach to identify a pedagogical approach in which learning entrepreneurial Know Why is facilitated. Thus, the purpose of this paper is twofold: to contribute to the theory of entrepreneurial learning and to contribute to the pedagogy for entrepreneurship, by explaining the meaning and significance of the entrepreneurial Know Why and by describing an educational approach that facilitates its development.\",\n",

(Pre- and post-evaluation of psychological attributes and its effects on entrepreneurial intention) Purpose Researchers have been trying to identify different psychological attributes which influence entrepreneurial intention (EI) and role of entrepreneurial education and training programs to develop these attributes among women. Therefore, the purpose of this study is twofold: firstly, to evaluate the difference among psychological attributes before and after an entrepreneurial education and training program. Secondly, to examine the effects of psychological attributes on EI among female students in Saudi Arabia.

Data were collected using a structured questionnaire from 310 female university students studying in a Saudi university and participated in this program. SPSS, version 20, was used to analyze the data. Findings Entrepreneurial education and training programs based on active learning and learner-centered approaches play an important role to significantly improve the level of psychological attributes and EI of female students. Furthermore, findings of this study also suggest that psychological attributes (training retention, self-confidence, tolerance of ambiguity, innovativeness and achievement motivation) positively influence EI.

       " \"Analysing cross-cutting competencies learning in an online entrepreneurship context Research in teaching innovation encourages leveraging the evolution of digital technologies from using the device to learning with the device, which means a change from using information and communicational technologies to learning and knowledge technologies. Nevertheless, although the feasibility of implementing active and interactive methodologies to improve education is widely recognised, more research is needed to obtain evidence on the subjects and contents with the most significant potential for success. In addition, the most recent literature claims greater attention to the improvement of transversal skills, as they are critical in the student's professional future. Thus, the main objective of this study is to contribute to the development of immersive learning aimed at improving the cross-cutting skills of university students. Developing a teaching activity where the student acts as an entrepreneur in electronic distribution channels faces the research question. The student-company-university collaboration is the basis for enhancing the transversal skills of the Degree in Marketing and Market Research at the University of Zaragoza (Spain). The student participates in each step of the program as an active agent. The teacher tutors the work teams in each process step, and the Palbin Company provides the necessary technical support. The students give the information to analyse the success of the experience through two surveys -pre and post-workshop, following the methodology used in previous literature. While the activity planning is complex, the students show an excellent mood during the experience. The comparison between expectations and performance offers significant success from the student's point of view. As a result, the student improves cross-cutting competencies and gains confidence, satisfaction with their learning at university, and professional experience.\",\n",

However, the increasing number of graduates of vocational courses becoming job seekers is worrisome. This study examines the perceptions of Nigerian university students about vocational studies and their entrepreneurial aspirations after graduation. The study examines the opinions of 251 respondents through the lens of Archer's agency and structure theory. The study considers the transition issues from learning skills to earning income for a living. Findings of the study reveal that most graduates of vocational agriculture are less likely to establish a farm/enterprise of their own and the majority want to obtain certificates required for securing employment in paying jobs.

Service learning fosters a strong relationship with community engagement offering hands-on experience. In this way, it may potentially prepare graduates from higher education institutions for an easier transition into the labor market. As to be able to address the question of whether service learning influences youth employment in Croatia, a study was conducted on 291 participants. The purpose of the research was to strengthen the links between service learning and youth employment in (social) enterprises. Methods applied two separate surveys, covering the topic of service learning and social entrepreneurship and youth, and the research was conducted from February to August 2021. The main findings point to the partial influence of service learning on youth employment in Croatia. Although it provides community engagement by introducing some hands-on experience, these skills and knowledge are still insufficient for the graduates' competitiveness on the labor market. In order to increase the impact of service learning on youth employment in Croatia, some service learning-related enhancements are proposed but, more importantly, reforms are needed in the (higher) education system in general as well as in the strategic framework on the social entrepreneurship.\",\n",

Effectuation is not only subjectified in entrepreneurship education, but has also become conceptualized as a method in the learning process. The purpose of this paper is to explore how students, who are novice entrepreneurs, react to working effectually and which barriers they face when applying effectual decision-making logics in a university course. Design/methodology/approach - A student-centered process course in entrepreneurship with 142 students provides a unique opportunity to explore the phenomena. Participant/teacher observations, written and oral work from the students and finally formal and informal written evaluations of the course by the students provide comprehensive data. Findings - The authors find that students experience three barriers to using effectuation. These are: noviceness, regarding the project as a school project, perceived lack of legitimacy of both the instructors and the process. Originality/value - The contribution of this study is threefold: first, to contribute to the understanding of the applicability of effectuation for novice entrepreneurs in the classroom; second, to articulate the factors that hinder entrepreneurial learning when effectuation is used in a process course; and third, to shed light on the importance of contextual factors for individual learning.\",\n",

Understanding entrepreneurial behaviour is essential to comprehend how entrepreneurs establish, promote, and expand new businesses. This study investigates the influence of entrepreneurial behaviour and innovation among undergraduate students of selected universities in southwest Nigeria. The target audience was made up of undergraduate students from selected private universities in southwest Nigeria. To be more precise, the purposive sampling method was used to choose the study's participants. To gather information from a varied cross-section of students, 370 copies of the questionnaire were distributed. Only 296 copies of the surveys that were sent out were returned, which indicates an 80.2% response rate. Structural equation modelling was used to examine the data gathered. The results showed that opportunity identification significantly influences innovation more than self-efficacy and risk tolerance. Opportunity identification is the most important factor of entrepreneurial behaviour that helps students to be innovative and become entrepreneurs.

As educators, if we are to take decolonizing seriously, we must create space for Indigenous Peoples to reconnect and engage with their own knowledge systems and ways of knowing. We present a teaching and learning case in entrepreneurship that explores an indigenizing process that makes visible Indigenous knowledge frameworks, practices and language in a business school classroom. Drawing on the suggestions from extant literature that research examining business school education should include micro-level studies, we examine the use of a virtual learning platform by Indigenous students engaged in entrepreneurship education. Three specific questions are addressed: (a) What might indigenizing look like? (b) How is learning created that supports active indigenizing practices? and (c) What is the role of the business school educator in the indigenizing journey? In answering these questions, we explore how Indigenous knowledge and wisdom can thrive alongside Western knowledge in a decolonized business school, and, in so doing, be part of the wider movement of decolonization of academia and society.',\n",

Vygotsky by reconceptualising the development of entrepreneurial expertise as artefact-mediated activity. This model is elaborated into some core pedagogical principles and contrasted with other approaches to entrepreneurial education. It also describes the piloting of this design perspective in a Master of Science programme in entrepreneurship. Students working as interns in high-tech start-up companies reflected on their practice and learned to learn using a number of artefacts as scaffolds. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical base of this paper is an instrumental case study of the pilot programme where the material is subject to documentary and narrative analysis. The master's theses of the students participating in the new start-up programme were compared with those of students in the regular programme using thematic analysis. Findings - The authors call for a more systematic examination of the model derived from Vygotsky in the field of entrepreneurship education. The exploratory study indicates that the emphasis on artefact-mediated action may strengthen systematic self-reflection and learning to learn among master's students in practice-based programmes. However, Vygotsky's focus on distributed agency should be complemented by a more personalized mentoring scheme.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the level of importance professionals directly involved in engineering teaching attribute to the main factors inherent to the implementation of an innovation and entrepreneurship-focused course. The applied method was the content analysis of interviews made with managers, coordinators, professors, and students from 4 of the major engineering schools from the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. One of the main identified changes in the teaching-learning processes of these HEIs was the project-oriented teaching. However, the interviewees believe there is a critical factor involved in the implementation of this model of teaching, which is the significant change in the professors' mindset. The process of cultural change is being implemented in different ways and, from the professors' points of view, people management aspects overlap technology use as far as their importance is concerned.\",\n",
       " 'How to implement entrepreneurship in LIS education: a Danish example The present article intends to illustrate how entrepreneurship-centered teaching and learning can be implemented in a LIS-specific context while at the same time thematizing the challenges of implementing entrepreneurship in a general university context. The paper presents a concept of teaching and learning that is designed partly to meet academic requirements and partly to work satisfactorily, and in an appropriate manner, in a specifically LIS-related (i.e., a non-business) context. The theoretical basis of this teaching-and learning-related concept is explained and discussed. In addition, the article presents particular experiences, results and achievements obtained in seminars and course units at the Royal School of Library and Information Science, where the concept was developed.',\n",
       " \"Effects of STEM-focused Arduino practical activities on problem-solving and entrepreneurship skills In this study, the effects of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) focused Arduino practical activities on problem-solving and entrepreneurship skills were analysed using qualitative and quantitative methods. Also, the contribution of these activities to teacher candidates and their effects on the learning-teaching process were discussed by evaluating their views. The study group consisted of 31 final-year teacher candidates studying in the science teaching department of a university in Turkey. The quantitative findings reveal that STEM-focused Arduino practical activities have a positive effect on improving the problem-solving and entrepreneurship skills of teacher candidates. Their opinions also support these results. The teacher candidates stated that the practical activities contribute to their professional development, support the development of 21st-century skills such as problem-solving and creativity and positively affect the learning-teaching process. As a result, STEM-focused Arduino practical activities are of significance in terms of adopting an interdisciplinary approach to education following the requirements of the century and developing problem-solving, entrepreneurial and productive individuals. Implications for practice or policy: STEM educators should integrate Arduino into STEM education to increase STEM learning outcomes. STEM educators should attach importance to STEM-focused Arduino activities to develop students' reflective thinking and entrepreneurial skills. Educators and researchers who want to use coding in STEM education may need to consider this article for example activities and implementation steps.\",\n",
       " \"Enhancing students' entrepreneurial mindset: a Swedish experience Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to report on the test of a pedagogical intervention to enhance students' entrepreneurial mindset on a university course. Design/methodology/approach - The course where the authors tested the new course design is a mandatory one in the business school's undergraduate business program. Pre- and post-evaluations of the students' opportunity recognition (OR) and individual entrepreneurial orientation (IEO) were carried out to measure the effects of an intervention aimed at enhancing these capabilities. Findings - The results from paired-samples t-tests indicate significant positive changes (enhancements) of the students' OR and IEO. The positive effects of the intervention methods are accounted for as evidence of the benefits of applying pedagogical methods that fit the learning style of young adults. Practical implications - The findings suggest that students' mindsets can be positively affected by an intervention tailored to enhance their OR and IEO capabilities. The findings have implications for curriculum development because the strengthening of these capabilities is a precondition for further development of the participants' innovative and creative thinking, as well as their entrepreneurial orientation. Since innovative and entrepreneurial activities have a positive impact on economies worldwide, the authors encourage the adaption of the intervention methods applied in this study in other settings. Originality/value - This paper reports the results of a pedagogical intervention aimed at enhancing students' entrepreneurial mindset. The findings from the study demonstrate that the applied intervention method supports the development of functional skills, which complement the conceptual knowledge gained from other courses in the undergraduate program.\",\n",
       " 'The role of information literacy in promoting discovery to cultivate the entrepreneurial mindset Purpose Accessibility to entrepreneurial education can be very restrictive because of associated barriers (e.g. add-on course/credit cost and prolonged duration) that prevent students from gaining entry into learning experiences. This study aims to provide an approach to address the gap of inaccessibility. This study proposes the integration of entrepreneurially minded coursework into aviation coursework using information literacy (IL) exercises by incorporating readings, videos, student-centered online discussions and student-facilitated presentations. Design/methodology/approach Students participated in an intervention consisting of five entrepreneurially minded online discussions where they watched a video or read an article and then responded to a series of questions. Upon completion of the intervention, participants completed a survey related to student learning outcomes and satisfaction. Findings The results from this study provide insight into changes in student perceptions after engaging in IL exercises designed to develop the entrepreneurial mindset. There is evidence that online discussions, journal article critiques and student-facilitated presentations are effective ways to integrate IL into aviation courses to cultivate entrepreneurial mindsets among students. Originality/value Several university-based approaches currently exist to help students develop an entrepreneurial mindset, including majors and minors in entrepreneurship, entrepreneurship coursework and centers for entrepreneurship that offer extracurricular learning experiences. Although these approaches offer a great foundation, they are typically viewed as extra with high barriers to entry. The limited focus on integration into coursework (whereby everyone gets an opportunity) prevents equitable access to a larger contingent of students. Therefore, in this study, we propose one approach to integrating the entrepreneurial mindset into coursework.',\n",
       " \"Cultivating Social Entrepreneurial Capacities in Students through Film: Implications for Social Entrepreneurship Education In South Africa, the economic, social, and political institutions designed to provide for the basic needs and fundamental rights of all citizens in society are failing to address the escalating socioeconomic problems for large segments of the population. Studies suggest that the provision of entrepreneurship education strengthens the entrepreneurial capacity of students to launch new ventures, which has economic implications in society (Mars, Slaughter, & Rhoades, 2008). Although much progress has been made, the authors argue that social entrepreneurship (SE) is not adequately taught in South African schools, and that this could be partially addressed by introducing SE education into the curriculum for preservice educators. In this regard, teaching and learning activities should be directed towards enhancing preservice teachers' sense of SE theory, and practical knowledge to inculcate an awareness of how SE can help deal with social injustices. Using a distinct case study that explicates teaching and learning through the use of film and online discussion groups, the authors show how spaces can be created to facilitate deliberative pedagogical engagement. The authors conclude that SE education offers valuable opportunities for dialogical (deliberative) pedagogical engagement, and should be considered as a constitutive element of higher education.\",\n",
       " \"Efficiency of Outsourcing and Outstaffing Mechanisms Based on MOOCs in the Market of Entrepreneurial Education Services The purpose of this article is to analyze, based on new experimental data, the effectiveness of entrepreneurship education using outsourcing and outstaffing (O&O) mechanisms based on the implementation of a massive open online course (MOOC). The field study was conducted among 205 undergraduate students enrolled in entrepreneurial programs in Management and Economics at three Russian universities. As a result of the study, the following hypotheses were confirmed. Namely, H1 Implementation of O&O does not reduce student satisfaction with the educational process, H2 Implementation of O&O does not reduce the level of students' understanding of theoretical teaching materials. H3 Implementation of O&O does not reduce the level of students' understanding of practical learning tasks, H4 The introduction of O&O has a positive impact on the business environment of the university. H5 The introduction of O&O has a positive impact on the entrepreneurial intentions of students, H6 The introduction of O&O does not reduce the level of students' achievements. At the same time, all O&O elements were included in the educational process through online access to MOOCs based on EdX. The practical significance of the results obtained in the article is that the proposed approach allows one to effectively implement outsourcing and outstaffmg for the organization of entrepreneurial education based on MOOC, the creation and connection of which does not require significant costs from the university.\",\n",
       " \"Enhancing Entrepreneurship Education in Engineering Students to Increase Their Metacognitive Abilities: Analysis of Student Self-Assessments It has been widely accepted that in today's society outstanding professional knowledge in one's own specific discipline is no longer sufficient for a successful career. It is increasingly important to enhance more generic abilities in individuals so they can apply their knowledge in real-world environments characterized by change, complexity and uncertainty. This has been addressed by sharing the importance of the development of metacompetencies in students studying engineering, allowing them to operate effectively, fostering entrepreneurship and employability. This can be achieved through entrepreneurship education in universities focusing on increasing creativity, self-efficacy, systematic thinking, awareness of opportunities and learning to learn. The aim of the current paper is to suggest a new approach to enhancing entrepreneurship education in engineering students through the development of their metacompetencies, with an emphasis on metacognition. The study includes a quantitative survey the results of which have been analysed using linear statistical analysis and Kmeans clustering. Furthermore, the role of personal characteristics, study level and disciplines have been analysed. The results confirm that the differences in levels of metacognition in students from different study levels and disciplines need to be considered when planning entrepreneurship courses. In addition, the study environment and motivation of students are important to consider when designing the programme for entrepreneurship courses.\",\n",
       " \"Constructive (mis)alignment in team-based experiential entrepreneurship education Purpose Little is known about how experiential entrepreneurship education approaches contribute toward enhancing the engagement of students in the learning process. Using a purposive and convenience sample of individual student reflective journals, the purpose of this paper is to critically evaluate how the process of constructive misalignment enhances the level of student engagement through a team-based experiential entrepreneurship education assessment. Design/methodology/approach Data were gathered from a purposive and convenience sample of reflective journals, an individual performance assessment element of three Masters-level courses (courses 1, 2 and 3) that included an active group business ideas generation presentation and a report. These texts were analyzed through content analysis that critically evaluates and summarizes the content of data and their messages. Findings While expected learning outcomes included teamwork and communication, the higher levels of active learning and student engagement related to innovation and generating a business idea was much more modest. Rather, the study finds that significant learning opportunities were apparent when students experienced unexpected aspects of constructive misalignment, such as linguistic-cultural challenges, nonparticipation and freeriding. Originality/value Building on Biggs' (2003) model of constructive alignment in course design and delivery/assessment, this paper elucidates various unexpected and surprising aspects. It suggests that constructive misalignment could provide major learning opportunities for students and is thus more likely in these team contexts where entrepreneurship students experience constructive misalignment. Educators should, therefore, continue to design experiential entrepreneurship courses and their performance assessments through team-based approaches that achieve higher levels of engagement as well as more active learning.\",\n",
       " \"A COVID-19 work-integrated learning strategy for entrepreneurial mindset reflections: Case study in Mexico In the current context of COVID-19 and the limited availability of physical workplace settings for work-integrated learning (WIL), this study explores the intervention of a WIL pedagogical strategy in order to support career development learning during the pandemic. The innovative Entrepreneurial Mindset (EM) reflective model introduced at a Mexican University employs experienced entrepreneurs as professors and mentors to teach entrepreneurial mindset reflection via online modality. The effectiveness of the model as a teaching and learning tool is assessed in a class survey of 203 students. The study concludes that although the application of the EM model to the curriculum is well suited to a non-physical workplace environment, the survey to assess mindset reflections could have been conducted both at the beginning (pre survey) and at the completion (post survey) of the course, to assess any changes in mindset reflections between pre and post. However, the introduction of 'growth' mindset reflections to a curriculum is a significant contribution to WIL literature and a valid COVID-19 strategy.\",\n",
       " \"Entrepreneurial learning requires action on the meaning generated Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to reveal how managers of small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can utilise their participation in research-based training to enable innovation and growth. Design/methodology/approach - Action research and action learning from a longitudinal study of ten SME managers in the wind turbine industry are applied to reveal SME managers' learning and the impact of the application of learning in the wind turbine industry. Findings - The findings of this study show that SME managers employ a practice-shaped, holistic, cross-disciplinary approach to learning. This learning approach is supported by theory dissemination and collaboration on perceived business challenges. Open-mindedness to new learning by SME managers and to cross-disciplinary collaboration with SME managers by university facilitators/researchers is required. Research limitations/implications - The research is conducted within the wind turbine industry, in which intense demands for innovation are pursued. The findings require verification in other industry contexts. Practical implications - This research contributes strategies for SME managers to utilise research-based training and for universities regarding how to work with SME training. In addition, public bodies can enhance their understanding of SMEs for innovation and growth. The learning approach that is suitable for specialisation in larger organisations is not suitable in the SME context. Social implications - SME learning is enhanced by a social approach to integrating essential large-scale industry players and other SME managers to create extended action and value from learning. Originality/value - The findings reveal the need for extended theory development for and a markedly different approach to SME training from that used for training managers in larger companies. This topic has received only limited attention in previous research.\",\n",
       " \"Introducing Team Learning in a Developing Economy: Students' Experiences of Experiential Entrepreneurship Education in Namibia We did not just become classmates, we became a family Entrepreneurship is considered to be a driving force behind nations' economic development, and entrepreneurship education's role is essential in shaping entrepreneurial attitudes, skills and culture. The objective of this study was to investigate students' experiences of entrepreneurship education in a developing economy, especially as regards learning in and through teams. The research project was conducted in Namibia, where the challenges to breaking out of poverty are huge. Methodologically, the study was based on qualitative thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews (2009-2014) of higher education students (N - 13) taking part in an action-based, experiential entrepreneurship programme. In the analysis of students' teamwork experiences, five main themes related to learning in and through teams emerged - the first three relating to individuals, the fourth to the team, and the fifth to wider social relations: (i) psychological safety, (ii) tolerance of uncertainty, (iii) strengthening of self-efficacy, (iv) strengthening of team-efficacy, and (v) understanding of others and other cultures.

       " \"Teaming up in entrepreneurship education: does the team formation mode matter? Purpose This paper investigates the importance of team formation in entrepreneurship education, and the authors ask: how do different team formation strategies influence teamwork in higher education experiential learning-based entrepreneurship courses? Design/methodology/approach Employing a multiple case study design, the authors examine 38 student teams from three different entrepreneurship courses with different team formation paths to uncover potential links between team formation and learning outcomes. Findings The authors find that team formation mode matters. Randomly assigned teams, while diverse, struggle with handling uncertainty and feedback from potential stakeholders. In contrast, student self-selected teams are less diverse but more robust in handling this pressure. Results suggest that in randomly assigned teams, the entrepreneurial project becomes the team's sole reference point for well-being. Seeking to protect the project, the team's ability to deal with uncertainty and external feedback is limited, stifling development. In student self-select teams, team well-being becomes a discrete reference point. This enables these teams to respond effectively to external project feedback while nurturing team well-being independently. Originality/value Education theories' implications about the benefit of team diversity may not apply to experiential learning-based entrepreneurship education's typical level of ambiguity and uncertainty. Therefore, educators may have to reconsider the unique dynamics of team formation strategies to ensure strong teamwork and teamwork outcomes.\",\n",

       " \"Impact of Self-Regulated Learning on Entrepreneurial Opportunity Recognition and Academic Entrepreneurship Performance The ratio of academic scientists to the labor force in Malaysia has increased. However, the contribution of academic scientists to commercialize research discoveries remains limited. Successful research commercialization or university technology transfer requires entrepreneurial effort that may involve skills beyond the traditional roles of academics. The ability to identify the commercial opportunity of research, i.e. entrepreneurial opportunity recognition, has been proven to be a critical skill for an academic entrepreneur. Earlier findings in this area would have been far more useful if the antecedents of entrepreneurial opportunity recognition were recognized. Although self-regulated learning has been inferred to as informal entrepreneurship education for academic entrepreneurs, there has been a lack of evidence on how it influences their academic entrepreneurship performance. This paper examined the characteristics of academic entrepreneurs and the key success factors, whether academics' opportunity recognition ability is influenced by their self-regulated learning behavior. A quantitative research design was employed based on a case study of a technological university in Malaysia involving 115 academic entrepreneurs. Structural equation modeling analysis results revealed that academics' opportunity recognition and social capital are the most important determinants of their academic entrepreneurship performance. The efficiency of the Technology Transfer Office and the ease of securing funding play influential roles too, but to a smaller extent. Most importantly, opportunity recognition is strengthened by self-regulated learning, through frequent deliberate practices in information and knowledge seeking that enable scientists to be more creative and innovative in translating research into marketable products and technology.\",\n",

       " \"Assessing entrepreneurial intentions through experiential learning, entrepreneurial self-efficacy, and entrepreneurial attitude This work investigates the impact of entrepreneurial experiential learning (EL) on students' entrepreneurial intention (EI), through the lens of entrepreneurial self-efficacy (ESE). To provide a comprehensive viewpoint, the direct impact of entrepreneurial attitude (EA) on entrepreneurial intention has also been looked at. This study, has adopted existing scales to measure entrepreneurial intention, entrepreneurial attitude, and entrepreneurial self-efficacy. For experiential learning, a structured scale has been designed on the basis of its existing scales. Data were collected from 669 students, enrolled in entrepreneurial courses/programs. Punjab, Haryana, and National capital region (NCR) are the three Indian regions considered for the survey. The results highlight that there is a positive influence of experiential learning on entrepreneurial intention though beta-value is low (0.042). While the beta-value with mediation influence of entrepreneurial self-efficacy between experiential learning and entrepreneurial intention was 0.090 (0.697*0.130), which states that entrepreneurial self-efficacy mediates and enhances the relationship between experiential learning and entrepreneurial intention. It was also found that there is a direct and strong influence of entrepreneurial attitude on entrepreneurial intention (beta-value, 0.872). Thus, there is a need to focus on entrepreneurial attitude, as it strongly influences the intentions of the students. Overall results have a bearing that experiential learning; entrepreneurial self-efficacy and entrepreneurial attitude emerged as important predictors of entrepreneurial intention and explained 89.6% of variations in the model. Moreover, experiential learning with the mediation of entrepreneurial self-efficacy had more impact on entrepreneurial intention. Thus, there is a need to focus on entrepreneurial self-efficacy as well as experiential learning.\",\n",

       " \"The Application of Flipped Classroom Combined With Locus of Control Analysis in Lean Entrepreneurship Education for College Students This paper aims to explore the status quo and basic laws of entrepreneurship education at the stage of social development in China, thereby providing a theoretical basis and practical guidance for the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents in colleges. First, a college entrepreneurship education model based on lean entrepreneurship theory and flipped classroom was established to provide the development of entrepreneurship education with a theoretical framework while improving the students' autonomous learning ability. Based on the theoretical basis of the influence of the locus of control on entrepreneurial motivation in the entrepreneurial process of college students, the students who participated in the basic education of entrepreneurship among the sophomores in the first semester of the 2018-2019 academic year of a college in Shanghai were selected as the research object. Then, the effect of lean entrepreneurship education under the flipped classroom mode was analyzed. Before the start of the entrepreneurial basic education course, there was no difference between the pretest scores of the research group and the control group students (P> 0.05). After the course, there was no difference between the posttest scores of the two groups of students (P> 0.05). It can be confirmed that, based on the flipped classroom education mode of halving the actual number of lectures by teachers, the effect of basic education on entrepreneurship for students is not different from the traditional teaching effect. Based on the flipped classroom mode, the number of people who have reached the level of understanding of the text target task is the highest, and the number of people who can reach the comprehensive application level of the high-order target is almost 0. It means that the realization of the high-order target still needs to be strengthened. Lean entrepreneurship education mode is based on lean iteration, which is conducive to promoting the development of entrepreneurship education in China. Therefore, the application of flipped classroom combined with locus of control analysis in lean entrepreneurship education for college students can ideally achieve the goal of deep learning, which is greatly significant for improving the effectiveness of entrepreneurship education.\",\n",

The research theorizes a relationship between EE, innovativeness (INN) as a dimension of personality traits (PTs), and EI, mediated by entrepreneurial motivation (EM). Additionally, in this study, INN played a mediator role between EE and EI. Design/methodology/approach All direct and indirect effects were tested using a quantitative approach. A sample of 240 undergraduate UQU students from different specialties was applied. UQU is witnessing an unprecedented movement that seeks to spread entrepreneurial culture throughout the educational system as a whole, following the recommendations of the Kingdom's 2030 vision. Findings The results indicate that EE and INN significantly predicted EI, though in an uneven manner. However, EM played a significant mediator role only between INN and EI. INN is a significant mediator in the relationship between EE and EI. Practical implications Future entrepreneurs must learn how to think, communicate, solve problems, deal with failure and exploit new opportunities. However, the debate over the contribution of EE to entrepreneurs is continuing. All educators, government officials, members of society and others are involved in encouraging entrepreneurial initiative. They should consider and understand how to affect entrepreneurial feasibility and desirability. Originality/value Variables included in the research model are not original; however, rarely in recent research works have psychological variables such as EM and INN been integrated into one model to explain the intention to enterprise business. This study provides a well-supported explanation of intention as a good predictor of entrepreneurial behavior that will be useful to all involved in encouraging potential entrepreneurs to succeed.\",\n",

The responses were analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistical methods. Findings The findings of the study indicate that farmers/landowners have low levels of entrepreneurship education (only 30.6% have received relevant education) and thus have higher needs. The 50.2% of respondents declare that they are willing to pay in order to attend an entrepreneurship education program. Research limitations/implications Existing entrepreneurship education research is useful in delineating the body of knowledge of what, when and how farmers need it, giving policymakers and researchers the opportunity to evaluate and build on research findings. Originality/value Given the shortage of identified research data, particularly at national level, on the role of education in agricultural entrepreneurship, this study contributes significantly to this research field, as the recognition of educational needs that affect the effectiveness of agri-business appears to be a crucial event for the future of agricultural entrepreneurship.',\n",

       " 'PRACTICES IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION IN SOUTH EAST EUROPE AND RUSSIA The REBUS project emerged in countries where the younger generations are reluctant to engage in private business and entrepreneurship, preferring safe employment at the public (state owned) enterprises. Their awareness of own entrepreneurship potentials is very low, while the capacity of talented and skilled students often stays unutilized once being employed. Thus the REBUS project supports embedding entrepreneurship to the South East Europe and Russian universities, at the same time creating network for cooperation between EU and partner countries. One of the first activities was identification, analysis and description of common practices in entrepreneurship education. For this purpose, a comprehensive desk research was combined with expert interviews to inquire about approaches of learning and teaching, connections to lessons, courses and extracurricular activities and approaches to validate entrepreneurial competences. The stocktaking related to the knowledge and differentiation on entrepreneurial competences, leading questions of the surveys related to gaps between formalised (HE) and informal (personal oriented, e.g. in internships) learning and assessment, potentials for enhancements of acquisition of those competences, validation of entrepreneurial competences and selection of key sub-competences. This paper presents results of research and needs analysis (stocktaking) and project objectives and first results.',\n",

Design/methodology/approach Qualitative data were collected from 24 focus groups of educators who had been tasked with embedding constructivist entrepreneurship education into their teaching and curriculum, at four different vocational colleges situated in four different provinces in China. The data were coded and analysed for emerging themes using a process of bottom-up thematic analysis. Findings A range of concerns were identified from the focus groups and these could be divided into five main challenges, which were the role of the educator in the constructivist learning process and their ability to control the process; the educators perceived student reaction to the process and their engagement with it; the time and technology required to deliver the process; the link between the learning and industry; and the educators' perception of the requirements to meet internal expectations. Research limitations/implications - This research explores the educators' perceptions of the challenges they face in developing and delivering active and experiential constructivist entrepreneurship education. Whilst these concerns may impact how the educators' approach the task, these concerns are only perceived, as the educators' have not yet implemented the introduction of constructivist entrepreneurship education when other challenges may become evident. Originality/value Encouragement by the Chinese Government to develop and deliver constructivist active and experiential entrepreneurship education has resulted in a number of tensions and challenges. Entrepreneurship education in China is still relatively young and under researched and this research contributes to the literature by exploring the challenges that educators face in developing and delivering constructivist entrepreneurship education in Chinese vocational colleges.\",\n",

       " \"Understanding and Predicting Students' Entrepreneurial Intention through Business Simulation Games: A Perspective of COVID-19 COVID-19 has disrupted educational institutes across the world. Teachers and students are now forced to teach and study online for an unidentified period, which severely hampers the learning capacity as well the student's intention toward entrepreneurship. This study compared the impact of traditional teaching and teaching through online management simulation games on student learning performance and further leads to entrepreneurial intention. To further understand the desirability of business simulation games, we used the technology acceptance model (TAM) and extended it by employing knowledge sharing, knowledge application, learnability, perceived pleasure, and self-efficacy as exogenous variables. For this purpose, time-lagged data were collected from 277 students enrolled in entrepreneurship courses in public sector universities. To deal with homogeneity and generalizability issues, students from different collaborative universities were asked to participate in the study. Structural equation modeling was employed for analysis, where the results depict that the students learning performance was enhanced after using simulation games compared to regular theoretical online lectures, which further encouraged them to be entrepreneurs. We also concluded that simulation games are novel and effective online teaching methodology for students during a time of crisis. The study concludes with its theoretical, practical implications, and directions for future researchers.\",\n",
       " \"Addressing progressive educational reforms: Fusing acquisition approaches and participation in Chinese entrepreneurship education Entrepreneurship education and pedagogic reforms advocating the increased use of progressive educational methods have been promoted by the Chinese government. In practice, this has led to a fusion of the more traditional teaching approach and more progressive approaches. This has led to calls for entrepreneurship education to be contextualized within the Chinese context, against the backdrop of the progressive pedagogic reforms. This paper addresses this by exploring how Chinese educators are responding to directives encouraging progressive pedagogic entrepre-neurship education, by applying the lens of Sfard's knowledge acquisition and participation -orientation learning metaphors. Interviews were conducted with fifteen educators and analysis of their narratives of practice was undertaken to identify knowledge acquisition and participation-orientation metaphors to elicit the approaches adopted in the classroom. The results indicate that both acquisition and participation approaches are adopted by educators, but in a way that reflects the traditional and cultural heritage that values knowledge. Educators still relied heavily on the transmission-acquisition metaphor, however the encouragement to introduce more progressive practices could be observed in two ways, the constructivist acquisition metaphor, and the participation metaphor. The former appeared more developed and the latter less so, although both are desirable in the light of the education reforms.\",\n",
       " \"An Insider's Perspective on Entrepreneurial Program Development at a Small and a Large Institution Entrepreneurship educators have an opportunity to learn from the entrepreneurship programs at both small colleges and large universities that have already sprouted up and experienced growth, challenges, failures, and ultimate successes. Programs that have contributed to the current entrepreneurship milieu can help leaders who are launching new programs or retooling existing ones, providing information to assist in defining their outcome objectives and refining their offerings. The development of new entrepreneurship programs, one at a private liberal arts institution and one at a large state-related research university, is evaluated. The common threads of what worked are identified, highlighting themes that other institutions of any size undertaking new initiatives can leverage. Themes discussed include the identification of institutional champions, communication with members of the student supply chain, and offering both non-credit, experience-based opportunities and dynamic for-credit courses. In addition, implementing a strategy that includes faculty partnerships, designated advisory boards, and refined bootstrapping skills helps to ensure that robust human and capital resources are available for program delivery, growth, and sustainability.\",\n",

This paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of learning experience through internship program at start-ups. This paper examines the benefits and challenges from stakeholders' experiences and perspectives (business students, start-ups and universities). The authors focus on the entrepreneurial values obtained by exploring start-up processes, culture and work environments. Design/methodology/approach This study uses qualitative research with a case study approach by applying experiential learning. The objects of this research are students of the School of Business and Management and start-ups in Indonesia. This study divides the pilot program of internship at start-ups into three stages, designing process, execution and evaluation. The analysis technique uses an interpretive approach from interviews and observations of internships based on experiential learning. Findings The results showed that the internship program at start-ups in this study has benefits for all major stakeholders, especially students. The results of student learning experiences show that start-ups' characteristics such as a creative work environment, egalitarian work culture and dynamic workflow flexibility can increase their professional and moral values. Research limitations/implications This study has several limitations, including the internship program designed in this study, which is still raw and has several shortcomings.

A curriculum analysis of the highest-ranking entrepreneurship MBA programs Entrepreneurship education has gained widespread attention in both education practice and research over the past three decades. However, whereas research has a strong focus on its effects and many normative concepts exist, little is known about how entrepreneurship is actually taught. To address this research gap, we conduct a curriculum analysis of the 50 best programs in entrepreneurship, according to the 2018 Financial Times ranking Top MBAs for Entrepreneur-ship 2018. In particular, we examine their objectives, learning contents and teaching as well as assessment methods as four major dimensions of a graduate entrepreneurship curriculum. The results show that the programs are primarily business and management programs, with a comparatively small share of entrepreneurship itself. Entrepreneurship-specific goals are entre-preneurial attitudes and competences, such as entrepreneurial leadership, entrepreneurial mindset, entrepreneurial skills, opportunity creation, opportunity identification, and trans-forming uncertainty into opportunity. The learning contents also focus on business, management, and law, whereas the contents relating to entrepreneurship include entrepreneurial failure, entrepreneurial management, entrepreneurial thinking, and entrepreneurship in general. Teaching methods are mainly the ones usually found in higher education, with business plans and prototyping as additional entrepreneurial ones. Assessment methods do not differ from those in business and management education.',\n",

Design/methodology/approach - Utilising design thinking, the pedagogy evolved over a three-year period (2013-2015) through iterative innovation in the delivery model and assessments, underpinned by notions of classroom community, constructivism, justice and equity, humour and role-play. Findings - The findings strongly validate the integration of notions of justice and equity, constructivism, humour and role-play as learning principles and delivery elements in entrepreneurship pedagogy to enhance student satisfaction and learning outcomes. A critical outcome of this design and delivery process is the reduction of barriers between students and teachers and the impact this has on creating a shared learning journey; a journey that in this case has resulted in meaningful outcomes for all involved. Research limitations/implications - Further research with longitudinal data is needed to validate the link between design-led entrepreneurship pedagogy and enhanced student learning outcomes as well as implications relating to graduate employability. In global settings, further data collection could also validate whether the findings are culturally neutral or culturally sensitive. Practical implications - Entrepreneurship educators will benefit from this pedagogical approach in seeking to meet the needs of business start-ups, intrapreneurial capacity-building and potentially, enhancement of graduate employability. The model also offers promise for other learning contexts. Originality/value - Design thinking has received scant attention in entrepreneurship pedagogy.

Design/methodology/approachUsing the interpretative phenomenological analysis approach, an in-depth study of postgraduate students' accounts of their lived experiences is conducted. FindingsConstruction of entrepreneurial identity influences students' entrepreneurial passion progression through a process of identity ecdysis that occurs deep within students' microfoundations as they make sense of the entrepreneurial identity role while simultaneously accommodating their anticipated entrepreneurial life journey. During the transition stage, they begin to let go of their present personal identities and recast new ones based on the revised personal entrepreneurship action agenda. The motivation to change results from the underlying future moral obligation, via a quest to uphold entrepreneurial virtues toward their significant immediate social circles as the aspiring professionals with newly equipped entrepreneurship proficiency. Entrepreneurial passion deepens as they come to grips with their new personal identities as well as new roles and responsibilities. Research limitations/implicationsWhile this study establishes a foundation for understanding how entrepreneurial passion progresses and is encouraged within an educational framework, it has the potential to be tested on actual entrepreneurs in the macro identity workspace. Practical implicationsEntrepreneurship education programs' learning experience structure should be designed based on the sources of entrepreneurial passion and is flexible enough to allow for in-depth exploration and self-introspection that supports the enactment of entrepreneurial characteristics that can benefit postgraduate students in their next career move by focusing on the internalization of entrepreneurial virtues, which enables the organic, autonomous construction of entrepreneurial identity. This approach may enable people's entrepreneurial passions to evolve organically yet profoundly.

The article advances the field's conceptual knowledge about EM and thereby facilitates future theory generation.\",\n",
       " \"Experts, entrepreneurs and competence nomads: the skills paradox in higher music education In this study, one-to-one tuition in higher music education (HME) was theorised as a culturally and historically grounded activity system consisting of relationships between musicians, instruments, music-making traditions and audiences. The 'skills paradox', as seen in the inherent conflict between musicians' need for long-term artistic training and society's demands for flexible knowledge producers and artistic entrepreneurs, forms a background to the study. With the aim of exploring how qualified experts with extensive experience verbalise the processes of transmitting musical craftsmanship and expressivity, the study was organised as a series of semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with 12 professional musicians teaching in HME. The study also formed part of an institutional developmental project spanning one academic year. Results point to the challenges in musicians' positions as being both carriers of tradition and innovative artists, and describe one-to-one teaching as a dynamic activity, where the sum of personal experiences often remains on an individual level and is seen as the property of a genial personality rather than as knowledge attainable for the collective of musicians/music teachers. It is suggested that the development of practice is dependent on an interaction between personal, educational and institutional levels and on an opening up of new zones of proximal development in which all agents in HME need to participate. By linking the individual and collective levels of knowledge, all aspects of the conservatoire tradition may be seen as potentials for development and expansion through the use of reflection and collaborative methods.\",\n",
       " \"Entrepreneurship training in tertiary education: Its development and transfer Self-employment is becoming an increasingly viable option for growing numbers of young people entering the labour market, so it is important to identify and develop good practice in the delivery of entrepreneurship training. Not only will this enhance the quality of its provision, but it will also serve to ensure that the economic benefits from larger numbers of start-ups and innovatory new businesses are fully realised. The development and transfer of training in entrepreneurship are examined. Recent studies indicate that its provision at the tertiary education level boosts new business formation, and that experiential learning in entrepreneurship provides students with more incentives to start their own enterprises on graduating than formal enrolment in business programmes. These studies further suggest a strong positive correlation between those European universities that have adopted strategies, resources and institutional infrastructures explicitly targeted towards entrepreneurial objectives and the quality of their entrepreneurship training provision. On this basis, tertiary education institutions need to adopt a holistic cross-disciplinary approach, which commits them fully to promoting opportunities for training students in the formation of enterprises and the translation of innovatory ideas into operational businesses. To be effective, this should involve campus-wide provision, as well as outreach and engagement with the community and its businesses. Evidence demonstrates a number of alternative pathways for the transfer of good practice entrepreneurship training to less developed countries. Bottom-up models depend on the establishment of centres of excellence. These need to develop the capacity to engage with their own government policy-makers in shaping national training initiatives along their own good practice lines. Top-down models depend on creating a policy-framework and funding sources sufficient to encourage the adoption of effective entrepreneurship training programmes across the national educational framework. Here the crucial issue is the ability of existing institutions to respond to such opportunities. Between these extremes, the German dual VET system offers an 'off-the-shelf' option for the transfer of vocational entrepreneurship training to less developed countries, which still requires extensive adaptation to local conditions.\",\n",
       " \"The impact of entrepreneurship education on the entrepreneurial mindset of college students in China: The mediating role of inspiration and the role of educational attributes Using a mediating model, this article highlights entrepreneurial mindset (EM) as a novel impact of entrepreneurship education (EE) and addresses the scarcity of research on the relationship between EE and EM. Based on 1428 valid samples from higher education students in China, the results revealed that the impact of EE on EM is complex. EE significantly enhanced students' entrepreneurial inspiration, which, in turn, promoted formation of students' EM. Entrepreneurial inspiration also mediated the impact of EE on EM at a significant level. In addition, the role of educational attributes, including the type of learning experience, type of course, and type of activity were highlighted. Finally, the direct effect of extracurricular activity was found to be significantly positive whilst that of curriculum attendance was significantly negative. Our findings contribute to theories of both EE and EM and particularly to the understanding of not only whether, but also how EE affects EM in higher education settings. The findings of this research can help to inform the future design and assessment of EE programs.\",\n",
       " \"Entrepreneurial learning in practice: The impact of knowledge transfer The aim of this research is to provide perspectives on how entrepreneurial practitioners, specifically owners of high-tech small firms (HTSFs), engage with knowledge transfer and learn. The authors draw on extant research and report on the views and observations of the principals in two case study companies in the HTSF sector with regard to growing their ventures and developing learning while part of a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) programme. Entrepreneurial learning is an area of significant interest due to the growth of entrepreneurship and the varied ways in which learning can take place. There are many different interventions that can be used to transfer knowledge and develop learning, but there is limited, if any, consensus on their respective effectiveness. The researchers used an ethnographic approach in two companies over an 18-month period. The study concludes that the KTP intervention facilitates an opportunity for learning through disruption, with the key barrier to any new learning being established practice. Interestingly, the findings suggest that entrepreneurial learning is greatly facilitated by 'on-the-job' learning.\",\n",

Thus, this study aims to analyse the relationship between the constructs innovation teaching, environmental sustainability teaching and entrepreneurship, in the perception of students of higher education institutions (HEIs) in Southern Brazil. The methodology used was a quantitative research, applied to 502 students of higher education, analysed through the modelling of structural equations. The results highlight that encouraging entrepreneurship has become a high-priority topic in teaching-learning practices, as entrepreneurial activities are being considered as a driving force for innovation. In addition, it is important to highlight that innovation teaching is an important way to enhance the entrepreneurial mindset of college students, which may contribute to the local economy, to the opening of new businesses, and to the income generation without environmental damage.',\n",
       " \"Practical Evaluation of Human-Computer Interaction and Artificial Intelligence Deep Learning Algorithm in Innovation and Entrepreneurship Teaching Evaluation The rise of knowledge economy has drawn much attention to Innovation and Entrepreneurship Education (IEE). IEE is conducive to helping graduates relieve employment pressure, and also to cultivating students' innovation ability and entrepreneurial willingness, which is also of great significance for promoting high-quality quantitative and sustainable development of social economy. However, the current IEE still has some limitations, such as the students' insufficient entrepreneurial willingness, low innovation practice ability, and unreasonable evaluation methods of innovation and entrepreneurship teaching, which hinder the further development of IEE. Therefore, for the purpose of further promoting the development of IEE, this article studied the evaluation of innovation and entrepreneurship teaching, and proposed an innovation and entrepreneurship teaching evaluation system combining Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Deep Learning (DL). The evaluation system was used to evaluate the innovation and entrepreneurship teaching of Class A and Class B. The evaluation result showed that Class A's innovation and entrepreneurship teaching evaluation score was 7; Class B's innovation and entrepreneurship teaching evaluation score was 7.1. The evaluation of innovation and entrepreneurship teaching in Class A and Class B was still not high enough, and the teaching quality and effect still needed to be improved; the innovation and entrepreneurship teaching evaluation system combined with HCI and DL had strong operability.\",\n",
       " \"Tourism Education: What about entrepreneurial skills? Tourism is generally acknowledged as one of the economic sectors with higher growth prospects worldwide. As a consequence, the number of tourism education courses has grown significantly in the last decades in order to meet the demands of the qualified workforce. Nevertheless, students who enter this sector will need different skills to face the challenges of this highly competitive and demanding industry. In this case, entrepreneurial skills are of paramount importance. The aim of this paper was to understand the perspective of tourism students on the relevance of entrepreneurship education within their courses. This study aims at describing an innovative teaching program called 'Learning to be', focused on fostering entrepreneurial attitudes and skills, through a project based learning methodology inspired in the Design Thinking process (Daniel et al., 2016). In this program, tourism students are challenged to develop viable solutions to real-case problems proposed by private and public organizations. A feedback questionnaire was developed to verify the impact of the entrepreneurship education program on students. It allowed to conclude that from the tourism students' perspective the embeddedness of entrepreneurship education within their courses was considered very relevant to assess future employment prospects, being the students both employees or self-employed. Students had also acquired and enhanced non-cognitive skills which are most valued by the tourism industry. This case study was also pertinent to identify best practices and propose guidelines for creating curricular spaces for the development of entrepreneurial skills. (C) 2017 The Authors.\",\n",
       " \"The impact of entrepreneurship pedagogy on nascent student entrepreneurship: an entrepreneurial process perspective Drawing on a general distinction underlying theoretical and practical-focused pedagogies, this study examines the nexus among entrepreneurship pedagogy, entrepreneurial intention, and opportunity discovery and exploitation of an entrepreneurial process. Data was obtained from nascent student entrepreneurs (n = 462) enrolled in Chinese universities or their recent graduates. Path analysis results reveal that practical-focused pedagogy contributes more to the entrepreneurial process than theoretical-focused pedagogy. Scrutinising entrepreneurship pedagogy respectively, theoretical-focused pedagogy has a more significant impact on opportunity exploitation; in contrast, practical-focused pedagogy is more influential for opportunity discovery. Results also demonstrate that entrepreneurial intention partially mediates the paths from engaging in practical-focused pedagogy and opportunity discovery and exploitation processes. Contrary to the hypothesis, a similar mediating role for the paths of theoretical-focused pedagogy is not identified. This research sheds light on the more nuanced effectiveness of entrepreneurship programmes on students' learning and the entrepreneurial processes by disentangling the heterogeneous nature of entrepreneurship pedagogy. It implies that opportunity recognition and exploitation are dependent upon knowledge and learning asymmetries resulting from the disparity of entrepreneurship pedagogies. Our findings suggest that the relationship between theoretical and practical pedagogies is of a reciprocal nature in yielding effective learning outcomes, calling for integration in teaching practice.\",\n",

Research purpose: To determine whether emotional intelligence is a crucial antecedent of entrepreneurial intention to encourage entrepreneurial behaviour. Motivation of the study: By identifying all the factors that encourage entrepreneurial behaviour, policymakers and concerned stakeholders are better equipped to improve such behaviour and guarantee its success, thereby alleviating unemployment more effectively. Research design, approach and method: A positivist paradigm was used and a quantitative design used self-administered questionnaires to assess the respondents' emotional intelligence and their intentions to start businesses. Multiple regressions and correlations were computed to test the hypotheses. Main findings: The findings revealed that there is a direct association between emotional intelligence and entrepreneurial intention, with the strongest association recorded between regulation of emotion and entrepreneurial intention and the least significant association between use of emotion and entrepreneurial intention. Practical implications: Although entrepreneurship education is important, it needs to be restructured to incorporate the practical aspects. Furthermore, educators should create a learning environment that could encourage the effective expression and use of emotions to nurture emotional intelligence.

       " \"INTERGENERATIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION: OLDER ENTREPRENEURS REDUCING YOUNGSTERS' SOCIAL AND WORK DISENGAGEMENT The current generation of young Italians leaving education have never entered the labour market with more years of schooling and higher levels of academic certifications as now. Nevertheless, they are losing out in the struggle for employment. It is a paradox experienced not only across Europe and poses questions about whether young people are being trained efficiently for twenty-first century employment. Nowadays employers require that young people possess skills-oriented learning that emphasises adaptability and preparedness for change. Italian Education systems, however, have not been responsive in this way. The intergenerational education approach may be an effective method for covering the mismatch between provided education and competences required on the labour market. Experienced older entrepreneurs may give young people Not in Employment, Education, or Training (NEETs) the confidence and intellectual resources to deal with the problems they will encounter through professional life, creating new spaces of autonomy and responsibility. Two focus-groups and questionnaires with 15 NEETs and 15 qualitative interviews and questionnaires to 50+ entrepreneurs were carried out in five European countries, Italy included, to understand how an entrepreneur could help youth to start their own business. Results from Italy demonstrate that to spread a culture of entrepreneurship, senior entrepreneurs are required to strengthen NEETs' confidence, initiative and courage, the ability to take risks and to invest in the future. Considering Lev Vygotsky's cognitive and social development theory as applied to intergenerational learning seniors need to act as a trigger to promote NEETs' entrepreneurial attitudes, capabilities and aspirations for life.\",\n",

The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of entrepreneurship education on students' entrepreneurship interest, intentions and competencies by implementing fashion entrepreneurship program. This study was held at Universiti Putra Malaysia for a period of five months. Samples were selected among undergraduate students who enrolled in Entrepreneurship Courses in First Semester 2016/2017. Screening process comprises interviews and basic sewing test were conducted to select 40 students as the respondents of the program. This program emphasized mentor-mentees system which involved 10 fashion entrepreneurs from the community. Respondents were exposed to entrepreneurship seminars, business and skills trainings, e-marketing workshops, sewing classes as well as evaluation sessions. Qualitative data were gathered through questionnaires adapted from Mc Clellandand Mc Ber & Co (1985) as well as questionnaires by Hisyamudin Hassan (2007). Meanwhile qualitative data were collected through continuous observations and the output of the fashion products. The findings indicated that there is a significant positive correlation between entrepreneurship interests with entrepreneurship intentions. Although the findings showed no significant relationship between fashion entrepreneurship program with entrepreneurship intentions and competencies, respondents' perceptions towards their interest, intentions and competencies at the end of the program are high. Due to time constraints, it was suggested that future entrepreneurship program should be scheduled more structured and in a timely manner to ensure that student can gain benefit throughout the program and the objective of the program can be achieved.\",\n",

Correspondingly, in addition to attaching importance to improving college students' entrepreneurial intention, college entrepreneurship education should pay attention to improving college students' entrepreneurial calling. At present, there is insufficient research on the association between entrepreneurial role models and entrepreneurial calling. We aim to study the mechanism and boundary condition of the association between entrepreneurial role models and entrepreneurial calling. MethodsA longitudinal survey was distributed among 519 students from 16 colleges and universities in China. In the survey, the college students answered questions on entrepreneurial role models, entrepreneurial calling, entrepreneurial perceived behavioral control and entrepreneurial hands-on practice. Hierarchical regression was conducted, testing the association between entrepreneurial role models and entrepreneurial calling of college students, mediated by entrepreneurial perceived behavioral control and moderated by entrepreneurial hands-on practice. ResultsTherefore, based on the social learning theory, the theory of planned behavior and the entrepreneurial event model, and by hierarchical regression of the data, this study confirmed that entrepreneurial role models were positively associated with college students' entrepreneurial calling by partially mediating with entrepreneurial perceived behavioral control. Moreover, Entrepreneurial hands-on practice positively moderated not only the relationship between entrepreneurial perceived behavioral control and entrepreneurial calling, but also the mediating association of entrepreneurial perceived behavioral control between entrepreneurial role models and entrepreneurial calling. DiscussionThis study not only enriches the theoretical research on entrepreneurial calling and entrepreneurial role models, but also provides valuable educational enlightenment for colleges and universities to improve the students' entrepreneurial calling.\",\n",

We describe how entrepreneurs initiated and operationalized support for Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), micro-credentials and fully online courses in pockets of innovation within existing institutional arrangements. An ambition was to understand why capacity building for digital transformation in a country described by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as digitally mature is lagging behind other countries. We obtained our data from qualitative interviews with faculties and staff involved in fully online course production. The informants were chosen through strategic sampling from support units and faculties, where they filled different roles in the production of such online courses. Our findings describe entrepreneurial activities that strongly contributed to the emerging social field of digital transformation. Located in pockets of innovation, the entrepreneurs provided open digital platforms, a pedagogy for online course design and support for faculties who engaged in online course production. Yet, the findings also confirm previous research pointing out how the lack of supportive leadership may impede successful digital transformation in higher education institutions. The study concludes with a model for digital maturity which may be useful to researchers and stakeholders. The model can also support entrepreneurial processes in online environments.',\n",

The purpose of this study was to explore the role of a marketing simulation game as a pedagogical tool to enhance the entrepreneurial mind-set and boost the predisposition of postgraduate students to become entrepreneurs. Design/methodology/approach Qualitative data from the feedback of students regarding their simulation experience in an advanced marketing course were collected and analyzed. Findings The reports showed that, in a simulation setting, entrepreneurial learning can develop students' entrepreneurial skills and encourage them to undertake entrepreneurial activities. The simulation experience allowed students to face challenges, overcome limitations, improve their analytical skills, and enhance their business knowledge. Research limitations/implications - First, these findings cannot be generalized as they are based on a small sample of students. Second, qualitative research is very reliant on the individual characteristics of students. Because of the restricted time of the module, the students were only allowed to run six rounds (the minimum) out of 10. More rounds would have benefitted student learning and increased the likelihood of capturing more of their insights.

This article describes a pedagogical approach and its outcomes in utilizing a multi-stage, multi-course, and multi-semester capstone integrative project to teach entrepreneurial marketing (EM) of early-stage technologies. Herein we explain concepts and practices that enable the learning needed within STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) MBA programs to commercialize and market products and services arising from new technologies. The pedagogy follows a four-course sequence that applies strategic frameworks and tools to develop opportunity space for a patented idea, develop the idea into product options, undertake customer discovery, build marketing and sales strategies, and translate opportunities into venture planning. These lab-to-market outcomes are accomplished by applying deliberate practice-based action learning methods to build students' knowledge bases and problem-solving process skills that increase their entrepreneurial expertise. Through learner engagement in a sequence of innovative, data-driven, analytical processes that focus on identifying, validating, and strategizing around scalable new ideas, this pedagogy enables students to learn EM skills that can be applied to different industries and companies at various stages of development but with an emphasis on early-stage technologies.\",\n",

Introducing AGILE reflection This article considers the relevance of current measures of employability and entrepreneurial (E&E) outcomes for evaluating the longer term value of a course of higher education (HE) study. HE stakeholders continue to discuss whether exit performance metrics engender positive or negative responses, with educators arguing that E&E outcomes should not focus heavily on hard skills, but should take into account a broader range of behavioural, attitudinal and mindset changes, claiming that these provide greater longitudinal value for graduates. Through a critical review of literature and models, the article explores the effectiveness of HE first-destination metrics in capturing E&E outcomes; whether explicit links exist between the metrics and outcomes; and what role students have in developing a narrative of their own E&E outcomes. The discussion examines 'atheoretical' perspectives in E&E education and issues of generalizability due to contextual variability, but identifies common key mindset dimensions that are incorporated into a proposed 'AGILE' learning tool so that students can reflect and develop a narrative of their E&E-related development against: adaptable, gatherer, identity awareness, life-long learning and enterprising capabilities. Thus, it sets out an approach that HE stakeholders may wish to consider embedding in their own curricula, which places the onus on students to reflect, self-evaluate and record personalized 'small wins'.\",\n",

Further, gender equity continues to be an issue in the entrepreneurial sector, particularly in STEM-focused entrepreneurship. In this context, this study was designed to explore the effects of a one-day female-focused STEM-based entrepreneurship program (for brevity, we call it the OzGirlsEntrepreneurship program) on the entrepreneurial intention of secondary school female students. The study collected data from two surveys completed by 193 secondary school female students, aged 14-16 years, who participated in the OzGirlsEntrepreneurship program. This program encouraged girls to develop and implement creative computational solutions to socially relevant problems, with an Internet of Things (IoT) component using the micro:bit device. The findings reveal that a key factor in the development of entrepreneurial attitudes in young female students is associated with soft-skills development, particularly in the areas of creative thinking, risk-taking, problem-solving, and leadership development. The importance of meaningful human connections, including positive role modelling and peer to peer learning were also important factors in fostering entrepreneurial intent. With these factors in mind, our findings highlight that the OzGirlsEntrepreneurship program substantially increased the entrepreneurial intention of secondary school female students.

However, there is little agreement on how to consider dimensions like international scope, interdisciplinary participation and educational format. This paper illustrates how benchmarking can support the product creation and improvement process of such an educational program offered in a digital format. Social Entrepreneurship for Local Change (SELC) is a European Union funded Erasmus+ consortium, which developed a digital social entrepreneurship course. The program's goal was to serve basic educational objectives of its students and teachers as well as strategic goals of the universities and the European Commission. Benchmarking, which has evolved to benchlearning, is a strategic management tool that measures the practices of one organization against the best practices of leading organizations in the same area. In this paper, the practices of SELC's digital program were benchmarked against two more mature digital social entrepreneurship programs using qualitative methods and resulting in a comparative scorecard. By recognizing and addressing quality gaps revealed by the benchmarking process, SELC's administrators can improve their own quality and put the program in the best position to achieve its goals.\",\n",

Design/methodology/approach - Primary data were collected in the form of 510 valid responses from engineering students across two technical universities in India, through a structured questionnaire consisting of scales adapted from the extant literature, and the data were empirically validated in this study. The reliability and validity measures of the constructs were validated through the confirmatory factor analysis, and the proposed hypotheses were validated using structural equation modelling. Findings - The results of this empirical analysis validate that the contextual antecedents have a significant positive impact on students' entrepreneurial orientation (EO), which, in turn, has a significant positive influence on EIs. Research limitations/implications - This analysis depicts the significance of EO as a perceptual driver at the individual level and substantiates that the availability of resources such as startup capital, access to business information, social networks and supportive university context significantly affects the decision-making process of an individual to venture into an otherwise uncertain occupation of entrepreneurship. Practical implications - The study has the likely potential to help university administrators and policymakers to allocate resources, develop strategies and provide effective entrepreneurial learning in entrepreneurship-oriented courses aimed at honing entrepreneurial skills and self-confidence of the university students. This holistic model can be used as a tool for resource planning and prioritising in order to provide the desired contextual support essential for fostering the IEO of the university students towards adopting entrepreneurial career, thereby assisting them to achieve their career goals and the broader objective of nation-building. Originality/value - This study adopts an innovative approach to empirically validate the EO construct at the individual level, which has been studied at the organisation (firm) level till today.

       " 'A relational perspective on entrepreneurial ecosystems: The role and sustenance of the entrepreneurship center Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of the entrepreneurship center (EC) in the larger entrepreneurial ecosystem. Entrepreneurial ecosystems thrive because of complex interdependencies and dynamic relationships between and among its participants. While the university has often been highlighted as a key player in the entrepreneurial ecosystem, the role of the EC within the university, despite its strategically influential position in stimulating entrepreneurship, has not received sufficient attention in scholarship. Design/methodology/approach The authors attempt to address this gap in scholarship using an expert Delphi panel approach to explore the vital role that the EC plays in ensuring the vibrancy of the regional entrepreneurial ecosystem. In doing so, the authors tackle the question of sustainability of the EC by outlining a structural framework and key job characteristics of the EC director so that it may thrive beyond the tenure of a transformational leader. Findings In analyzing the responses of Delphi panelists and reviewing the theoretical foundations, the authors have identified three areas for discussion: the question of whether the EC director ought to be an academic job, the key skills of an effective EC director and how to sustain the EC after the departure of a transformative leader. Considering the vital role that the EC plays in the university and regional entrepreneurial ecosystems, these questions have importance for the future of the practice of entrepreneurship. Originality/value The role of the EC in the larger regional entrepreneurial ecosystem and the impact of the EC director are subjects that have been largely unaddressed by current scholarship. This is despite the growing number of ECs, the growth of entrepreneurship as a discipline, the desire to foster entrepreneurial universities and the struggle to find suitable EC leadership talent. The EC is critical for bringing together various actors within the regional entrepreneurship ecosystem, creating and maintaining an entrepreneurial culture and fostering co-curricular learning to develop human capital, key benefits that the university provides on top of its research activity.',\n",
       " \"A Video Game for Entrepreneurship Learning in Ecuador: Development Study Background: Games have been a part of human life since ancient times and are taught to children and adults who want to simultaneously have fun and learn. Nevertheless, in the third decade of this century, technology invites us to consider using video games to learn topics such as entrepreneurship. However, developing a serious game (SG) is difficult because everyone who forms part of the game development team requires adequate learning resources to acquire the necessary information and improve their game development skills.Objective: This work aimed to detail the experience gained in developing ATIC (Aprende, Trabaja, Innova, Conquista [learn, work, innovate, conquer]), an SG proposed for teaching and learning entrepreneurship.Methods: To develop a videogame, first, we established a game development team formed by professors, professionals, and students who have different roles in this project. Scrum was adopted as a project management method. To create concept art for the video game, designers collected ideas from various games, known as getting references. In contrast, narratology considers the life of a recent university graduate immersed in real life, considering locations, characteristics, and representative characters from an essential city of EcuadorResults: In a Unity 3D video game in ATIC, the life of a university student who graduates and ventures into a world full of opportunities, barriers, and risks, where the player needs to make decisions, is simulated. The art of this video game, including sounds and music, is based on the landscape and characteristics of and characters from Cuenca, Ecuador. The game aims to teach entrepreneurs the mechanisms and processes to form their businesses. Thus, we developed the following elements of an SG: (1) world, (2) objects, (3) agents, and (4) events.Conclusions: The narrative, mechanics, and art of video games are relevant. However, project management tools such as leaderboards and appointments are crucial to influencing individuals' decision to continue to play, or not play, an SG. Developing a serious video game is not an easy task. It was essential to consider many factors, such as the video game audience, needs of learning, context, similarities with the real world, narrative, game mechanics, game art, and game sounds. However, overall, the primary purpose of a serious video game is to transmit knowledge in a fun way and to give adequate and timely feedback to the gamer. Finally, nothing is possible if the members of game development team are not satisfied with the project and not clear about their roles.\",\n",
       " \"Entrepreneurial Intentions of Vocational Education Students in Indonesia: PLS-SEM Approach Cultivating entrepreneurial intentions in vocational education students is important in preparing graduates ready for entrepreneurship. However, efforts to foster entrepreneurial intentions are still a serious problem in vocational education. This study examines the structural model of the influence of entrepreneurial interest, technological competence, digital marketing, internship experience, self-efficacy, and entrepreneurial personality on entrepreneurial intentions. Ex-post facto research with a structural approach involving 618 vocational education students in Indonesia. Data was collected through a closed questionnaire with a Likert scale of 1-4 distributed using Google Form media. The collected data were analyzed using structural equation model analysis with path analysis and bootstrap methods. The study results show that technological competence, digital marketing, and apprenticeship experiences significantly affect the growth of entrepreneurial intentions. In addition, self-efficacy and entrepreneurial personality also significantly succeeded in mediating the influence of technological competence, digital marketing, and internship experience on entrepreneurial intentions. Teachers as learning facilitators must foster an interest in entrepreneurship as the basic root of the spur to form aspects of competence and experience needed in the business world. This aspect must also be given and strengthened to form a personality in entrepreneurship and strengthen self-efficacy so that the estuary of entrepreneurial intentions inherent in students will be stronger. This research is limited to certain variables based on the current actual theory. Future research needs to examine more deeply the potential influence of other variables that are more effective in growing students' entrepreneurial intentions in vocational education.\",\n",

This article chooses to conduct research by conducting a survey on the entrepreneurial willingness of postgraduates in universities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and its influencing factors. From the perspective of master students from five universities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the selection of personal background information, entrepreneurial attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavior control, and entrepreneurship education index factors establish the index system of the influencing factors of graduate students' entrepreneurial intention and use the TPB theoretical model and SPSS data statistics and other tools to analyze the obtained data results. The results show that gender, major, place of origin, part-time experience, and entrepreneurial experience of relatives and friends correspond to 0.000, 0.000, 0.482, 0.172, 0.003, and 0.004, respectively. It can be seen that the independent variables, major and place of origin, have no statistical significance. In the statistics of college students' willingness to start a business, 23.33% of the students said nothing at all, and 27.8% of the students said thought, but would not start a business. It can be seen that entrepreneurial attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control all positively affect entrepreneurial willingness, and only learning ability, opportunity grasping ability, self-recognition ability, and decisiveness have a significant effect on entrepreneurial willingness.\",\n",
       " \"Social Entrepreneurship Education as an Innovation Hub for Building an Entrepreneurial Ecosystem: The Case of the KAIST Social Entrepreneurship MBA Program As social problems become more extensive and diverse, one of the most critical capabilities of social entrepreneurs is connecting and aligning various stakeholders. Social entrepreneurs can solve problems better through collaboration with stakeholders, and this leads to sustainable innovation of society. Accordingly, social entrepreneurship education (SEE) programs should be designed and operated to cultivate social entrepreneurs' abilities to enhance connectivity with all relevant entities of the social enterprise ecosystem. Consequently, SEE can form ever-growing communities of social entrepreneurs while functioning as innovation hubs for entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEs) evolving on their own. To this end, this study proposes a design and assessment framework for SEE. The framework emphasizes strengthening internal connectivity among SEE program members and external connectivity with outside entities, including universities, firms, government agencies, civil societies, and natural environments. This framework clarifies how and to whom social entrepreneurs should connect throughout the SEE process. This paper analyzes the case of an MBA degree SEE program in Korea using this framework and identifies directions for further improvement of SEE, contributing to the social entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship education literatures by integrating SEE's key features with social theories of learning and the quintuple helix model for sustainable innovation ecosystems. Practically, our findings provide a useful benchmark to find isolated internal and external entities that need more active interactions to achieve SEE's purposes.\",\n",
       " \"A value-creating framework for enhancing entrepreneurial learning in networks Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to conceptualize and outline the social infrastructure that nurtures and strengthens cooperation in business networks promoting cultural tourism and thereby facilitates entrepreneurial learning. The role of the higher-education (HE) provider is emphasized on different levels of the value-creating framework. Design/methodology/approach - To explore and analyze the benefits of cooperation in business networks promoting cultural tourism as perceived by entrepreneurs, participants in the fields of both culture and tourism in two workshops were observed. From the information produced in the workshops, ethnographically oriented data were selected. Findings - Benefits that inspired cooperation among the members of the tourism business network were identified, which were categorized as functional, relational and symbolic. On the functional level, the actors involved, the entrepreneurs, considered it important to have an opportunity to meet and discuss in a stimulating atmosphere. The role of the HE provider at this stage was that of a facilitator, in other words, to set the scene. On the level of relational cooperation it was more important to foster relations between the network actors, and the provider's role changed to that of a matchmaker. On the symbolic level, it is essential that all parties of the cooperation work together to find new business solutions based on common values. At this stage, the role of the HE provider is that of a co-creator. Research limitations/implications - As a case study, this research represents the local context of entrepreneurial cooperation in business networks promoting cultural tourism. Further study is needed to develop a framework that encompasses change in the traditional roles of the learning environment. Practical implications - Teaching and training approaches derive from the contexts in which micro and small businesses and their networks learn. HE offers students a safe environment in which to experiment and innovate, thereby linking student academic work to real-life project performance. Originality/value - Interaction/network theory is combined with the discussion on entrepreneurial learning.\",\n",
       " 'Applying Authentic Learning through Cultivation of the Entrepreneurial Mindset in the Engineering Classroom Higher education provides plenty of opportunity for theory and in many cases, even the ability to apply theory in a laboratory setting. Yet, there remains limited opportunity for students to learn by doing through participation in authentic learning experiences. The purpose of this paper is to provide one potential solution for integrating authentic learning into the engineering classroom by cultivating the entrepreneurial mindset. As entrepreneurship serves as an integral part of the economy, developing an entrepreneurial mindset through authentic learning experiences is essential for engineers. While online discussion prompts represent a useful way for educators to facilitate student learning, less is known about how to facilitate online discussions in a way that truly cultivates an entrepreneurial mindset for engineering students. In this paper, the key intentions of entrepreneurially-minded learning are reviewed, and a guide for creating online discussions applicable to any engineering course is presented. Example online discussion prompts incorporating the entrepreneurial mindset are then shared from an Introduction to Engineering course. Results from a mixed methods survey instrument suggests positive impacts towards student perceptions of online discussions and development of the entrepreneurial mindset. Recommendations for effectively and efficiently facilitating online discussions for entrepreneurially-minded learning in the engineering classroom are offered.',\n",
       " \"Research on Data Analysis of Efficient Innovation and Entrepreneurship Practice Teaching Based on LightGBM Classification Algorithm The transformation of innovation and entrepreneurship practice teaching and education methods has put forward higher requirements for the intelligence and personalization of online education platforms. The aim of this study is to predict learning outcomes based on students' learning outcomes and habits, identify weak areas of knowledge, and provide targeted guidance and recommend the most suitable teaching resources. According to the concept of LightGBM model and the method of Feature selection, the research puts forward an integrated classification model ELO-LightGBM based on Elo Rating System (ELO) scoring system and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), trying to further mine the potential information of the practical teaching management data set. The model obtained a score of 0.7928 when using the dataset training, and a large number of comparative experiments were carried out between the ELO-LightGBM model and other classification models in different public datasets. The experimental results proved that the ELO-LightGBM model is more accurate than other classification models. In the comparative experiment on the practical teaching data set, the accuracy of the ELO-LightGBM model also surpassed the LightGBM model and the linear support vector machine model that performed well in small data sets, and the model was in the accuracy rate. The accuracy rate of winners in the comparison of micro-average is as high as 82.6%. It can be seen that the ELO-LightGBM model is of great significance to the intelligence and personalization of the online education platform.\",\n",
       " \"Factors influencing entrepreneurial intentions of Chinese secondary school students: an empirical study The ideal stage to learn about and foster positive attitudes toward entrepreneurship is believed to be during childhood and adolescence. However, most entrepreneurial studies examine college rather than secondary school students (SSS). Based on a modified theory of planned behavior (TPB), this study used stratified cluster sampling and a questionnaire to review current entrepreneurship education in secondary schools. In addition, the effects of entrepreneurship education, personal traits, and demographics on attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control (PBC), and entrepreneurial intentions (EI) on 1018 SSS in China were studied. Differences, correlations, and structural equation modeling analysis indicated the following. (1) Most SSS had never received entrepreneurship education, likely resulting in lowered entrepreneurial intention and perception of entrepreneurial behavioral performance as unrealistically easy. (2) Cognitive bias existed in SSS's perceptions of entrepreneurship, and entrepreneurial behaviors were regarded as external cause-oriented activities. (3) Gender and entrepreneurial experience of family member also influenced EI and related variables. (4) Entrepreneurship education and personal traits (locus of control and innovativeness) were significantly positive predictors of EI, and (5) their effects on EI were completely mediated by PBC. The findings supported the TPB predictions, and the results offered some implications for entrepreneurship education in Chinese secondary schools: (1) developing entrepreneurial personal traits while eliminating examination-oriented education, (2) enhancing SSS's entrepreneurial confidence so entrepreneurial behaviors are perceived as easier and more achievable, and (3) constructing systematic entrepreneurship courses to guarantee transition from secondary to higher education.\",\n",
       " \"Students' career interests and entrepreneurship education in a developing country PurposeStudents' career choices and programmes of study are perceived to influence student understanding of many courses. Yet, research attention is limited on entrepreneurship education that is a panacea for unemployment. Thus, this paper aims to assess the influence of students' career interests on students' comprehension of the entrepreneurship curriculum from a developing economy perspective.Design/methodology/approachThe study adopts a mixed-method approach and explanatory sequential design is used to collect the data from 575 student studying entrepreneurship course in Ghana.FindingsThe results show that there is no statistically significant relationship between students' career interests and students' comprehension levels in concepts taught in the entrepreneurship curriculum but a statistically significant relationship between students' programme of study and students' comprehension levels in concepts taught in the entrepreneurship curriculum in Ghanaian universities.Practical implicationsThe findings imply that the entrepreneurship course should be taught practically. This can be accomplished by creating a virtual enterprise modelled after a successful enterprise. This will help students understand the concepts being taught. Second, students who study different programmes should be taught using different methods. Lastly, students who study non-business-related programmes should be taught using methods that emphasise the basic ideas to aid students' understanding.Originality/valueThis study has made significant contribution by successful adopting the Piaget's cognitive constructivism to the learning of entrepreneurship from a developing country perspective and establish that no statistical relationship exist between students' career interests and students' comprehension levels in entrepreneurship education.\",\n",

Attention is drawn to the importance of entrepreneurship as an essential asset and feature of public administration and public policy education at higher educational institutions in Germany and the United States. The paper aims at filling a research gap because knowledge about the interrelationships between entrepreneurship and public administration and public policy education is still underdeveloped. Emphasis is put on the discussion why entrepreneurship should be incorporated in curricula and how study programs have been designed or reformed, while placing emphasis on entrepreneurship in meeting current and complex challenges in the public sector. Findings from a systematic online assessment are presented which show whether and how policy, public and social entrepreneurship are taught as an integral element of current governance and public policy study programs and what difference it makes teaching and learning wise. The findings reflect a high demand for entrepreneurship education by public administration and public policy students, on the one hand, and a low incorporation in curricula, on the other hand. Two case studies from Germany and the United States are presented which serve as good practice examples on how to transfer public, policy, and social entrepreneurship into curricula.',\n",

It draws upon the frame mobilization literature, which illuminates the role that acts as interpretation play in instigating, promoting and legitimating collective action with aim to provide quality entrepreneurial education. Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire survey based on a literature review built by Stimulating Learning for Ideas to Market (SLIM) project partner was employed to test the given perspective. A total of 380 businesses completed the survey from 12 to 20, November 2013. Participants have different profiles, act in diverse roles and industrial sectors. Identification of appropriate types of support, education, training and advice was made to recognize what small businesses need and can use to improve their operations.

It discussed the impacts of formal and informal ways of intellectual property protection in sales and exports market (SLIM) project partner was employed to test the given perspective. Research limitations/implications - Main limitation lay in unequal sample response among countries. However, results proofed very similar response in all questions among three countries even size, entrepreneurial development, GDP or historical background are highly different. Practical implications - Therefore, the original contribution of the paper lies in the authors' empirical investigations into the current thinking and practice of existing entrepreneurs by suggesting some implications of this point, which should be of interest to all stakeholders who design courses in IP and who engage in social mobilization. Social implications - There are important organizational culture barriers with this target group, such as the emphasis on the need to publish and an unstable/unavailable IP budget. The integration of IP tools into curricula is an important step to improving the use of IP tools by future researchers. There is an indisputable case for integrating IP as an R&D output and increasing the valuation of IP for academic promotion. Originality/value - This paper illustrates the current challenges on SMEs' educational needs and intellectual property rights carried out in among 380 entrepreneurs across the Republic of Croatia, the Republic of Poland and the UK. Most intriguing suggestion, perhaps, is that the role knowledge cooperation with universities may play as a breaking point to fully exploit SMEs' innovative potential. Surprisingly, needs for establishing a classification of diverse IP-management and collaboration-management tools useful in university-enterprise collaborations, within a general context of IP and open innovation has not been recognized.\",\n",
       " \"Leveraging experiential learning to incorporate social entrepreneurship in MBA programs: A case study Social entrepreneurship in business education is growing in importance as a way to teach ethics and instill high ethical standards in individuals. One effective way to integrate social entrepreneurship is through experiential learning; where the participant is actively involved in processing the knowledge and developing skills, while being involved in the learning situation. MBA programs are currently beginning to incorporate social entrepreneurship into their curricula to teach their students, as well as developing students' intercultural skills. An examination of the current trends will be followed by an analysis of how business schools can effectively incorporate social entrepreneurship into the MBA curriculum. To tie these concepts together, the paper provides a case study of a program run by Emzingo, a leadership development company, and IE Business School. The reasons for the in-depth case study are three-fold. First, it provides an example of how business schools can use experiential learning to incorporate social entrepreneurship in an international context. Second, it highlights the benefits of incorporating social entrepreneurship in MBA programs. Finally, it provides a general framework for business programs that are looking to integrate various social entrepreneurship elements in their MBA programs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

       " \"Uncoupling innovation and entrepreneurship to improve undergraduate education Purpose When it comes to undergraduate education, the terms innovation and entrepreneurship are often used interchangeably with respect to curricular practices and their associated learning and developmental outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to chart a course through the vast and growing multidisciplinary literature covering both topics to argue that innovation and entrepreneurship are not only different concepts, but they also play out in postsecondary institutional contexts in different and important ways. Design/methodology/approach Based on these differences, the authors propose that developing innovators must precede teaching future entrepreneurs and that the home of innovation education is not necessarily in the business school at all. Ideally, the authors believe innovation should be taught separately from any one disciplinary context. To illustrate the concept, the authors point to an existing program where professors and students from different disciplines work together on actual problems provided by external clients from both the public and private sectors. Findings Based on the authors' rationale and approach, the authors propose an agenda that would allow for a deep analysis of the interaction between organizational behaviors and student outcomes, providing insight into effective practices and strategies for mobilizing institutional efforts aimed at teaching innovation and better aligning innovation with entrepreneurship education. Originality/value The authors provide a clear rationale for separating innovation and entrepreneurship pedagogy in higher education, terms that have been conflated in literature and in practice for nearly a century. The authors do this in an original way by pairing a theoretical framework with a short case study of an education program that has developed innovation pedagogy at the undergraduate level.\",\n",
       " 'Implementing strategies of entrepreneurship education in Zimbabwe Purpose The aim of this paper is to explore how the strategies of entrepreneurship education in clothing and textile programmes are implemented in selected Technical Colleges in Zimbabwe. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative research approach was adopted for this paper. Purposive sampling technique was used to collect data from 42 participants through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. Findings The findings show that there were two principal strategies that are used by lecturers in technical colleges, where entrepreneurship education is taught. The findings reveal that the implementation of the lecture method in most of these colleges deviates remarkable from each other. Given the socioeconomic and linguistic backgrounds of the learners, lectures are delivered in both English and the dominant local language, and the notes are written on the blackboard. Experiential learning, which is the placement of students in textile and clothing industries, was revealed to be another strategy, which was not achieving the intended results as most of the students were engaged in unrelated activities. The implementation of the two methods fall short of internationally recognised and pedagogically acceptable strategies that ought to instil the necessary skills in students to become future entrepreneurs in the textile and clothing industries in Zimbabwe and in Africa. Research limitations/implications One of the limitations of the paper is that data was not collected from production managers from the clothing manufacturing industry and from the Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education officials, especially those from the Curriculum Development Unit. However, the core of this paper is on implementing strategies from the perspectives of lecturers and students. Another limitation of the paper is that data was collected only from three technical colleges in Harare, Manicaland and Midland provinces. There are a total of nine such colleges in Zimbabwe. Nonetheless, since this a qualitative paper, its aim is not to generalise its findings but to provide in-depth and rich information about implementing strategies in Clothing and Textile programmes in selected TVET colleges. Originality/value The paper presents some pertinent recommendations to enhance a better implementation of the strategies used in entrepreneurship education to ensure that upon graduation, graduates can be self-employed and create jobs. This could help in curbing the high unemployment rate in Zimbabwe as well as in Africa in general.',\n",
       " \"Instilling innovation and entrepreneurship in engineering graduate students: Observations at the University of Calgary Today's employers not only want graduates who are critical thinkers and problem solvers that are able to work in teams, but also individuals that understand innovation and how to use entrepreneurial activities to move innovations to become benefits to society. For research-based graduate students, this is even more desired, with emphasis on an understanding of innovation processes and the realization of the role that innovation plays for the survival and growth of existing corporations as well as the key contribution it makes in start-up companies. Many engineering programs focus on traditional engineering attributes, and although these are essential elements that engineering graduates should learn through their training, little attention is paid to innovation and the conversion of innovations to realized impacts. Here, we review innovation and discuss our experience with trainees (graduate students and post-doctoral scholars) and how to engage them in innovation activities. Our observation is that innovation is coachable and can be cultivated in research-based trainees. We recommend nine actions (understanding the challenge, motivation, safe and mentored local environment, tolerance to failure, diversity, rewarding of passion, awareness of the external, internal-external environment, and creative destruction and preservation) that trainees should be exposed to in order to promote innovation and entrepreneurial activities so that they can establish and/or strengthen their innovation and entrepreneurship muscles, which hopefully continues after they leave university.\",\n",
       " 'TRAINING IN DIGITAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP AS A BASIS FOR FORMING THE INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL OF NATION Nowadays, digital technologies have a significant impact on how business perceptions change and how new businesses are created. The new technological paradigm harnesses the potential of collaboration and intellectual capital to develop and implement more robust and sustainable entrepreneurial initiatives. However, while a research in digital entrepreneurship is relevant and timely, there is a limited amount of studies on the real impact of digital technology and intellectual capital on entrepreneurship education, although inquiries into digital entrepreneurship theory and practice have drawn more attention in the recent years. Moreover, at the current level of globalization, society, as practice shows (the situation with COVID-19), is not protected from global shocks in the form of chain crises and pandemics. Therefore, digital entrepreneurship is also able to help solve the economic problems caused by the above phenomena. The purpose of the article is to analyse and clarify various aspects of training students of economic specialties in digital entrepreneurship; formulate the tasks that arise while using digital technologies in the economy, and determine the ways to solve them in the education system. Among many forms of digital entrepreneurship training, online courses are one of the strongest trends and they do affect the content and flow of teaching and learning. This article also focuses on better understanding the skills, opportunities, and risks involved in using the online courses as a new way of training entrepreneurship in higher education system. The authors empirically study the problems and drivers for developing such courses as a new pedagogical concept. The results show that such a course is flexible in time and space and can therefore contribute to the accessibility of entrepreneurship education.',\n",
       " \"Entrepreneurship education - paradoxes in school-company interaction Purpose The purpose of this paper studies the role of paradoxes in the adoption of entrepreneurship education (EE) in schools. Design/methodology/approach Qualitative research methods were used, and the data were collected via semi-structured interviews with Finnish teachers and principals. Findings Paradoxes are an important factor slowing the adoption of EE. Paradoxes appear to arise from teachers' misunderstandings, high personal standards of pedagogy and an unwillingness to change their routines. In schools, principals still regard EE as a newcomer that is easily abandoned should any difficulties emerge. The principals show unwillingness to take responsibility for managing EE or to establish relationships with companies. Research limitations/implications - The study represents Finnish practice in basic education. Due to the qualitative methodology applied, the generalizability of the results is limited. Quantitative research on the teachers' and principals' behaviour related to paradoxes in EE is needed. Furthermore, the pedagogical prioritization related to the introduction of EE warrants more research. Practical implications - The results suggest good opportunities exist in training to prepare teachers and principals to anticipate the difficulties of EE. Originality/value The study introduces a new understanding of the difficulties in the adoption of EE. Paradoxes are important factors to take into account in the promotion of EE. Paradoxes stem from teachers' misunderstandings, misconceptions and their unwillingness to change. Principals seem unwilling to assume their responsibilities in managing EE. The study highlights opportunities for managing the emergence of these paradoxes by preparing teachers and principals better on the difficulties and unexpected outcomes of EE.\",\n",

Based on eclectic entrepreneurship theory, we present an original work that uses artificial intelligence to forecast the macrolevel determinants of entrepreneurial opportunity. Modern artificial intelligence could open new areas for future research opportunities in entrepreneurship and help close the gap between theory and practice. Our empirical analysis offers two major results by using a panel dataset of 149 countries covering 2007-2018 and six machine-learning models. First, entrepreneurs prefer to exploit opportunities in countries with stable economic governance that provide high education standards, health, social capital, and a safe, natural environment. Second, CatBoost regression performs better in predicting entrepreneurial opportunity compared to linear regression and more advanced machine-learning models.

       " \"The network of relationships between the economic environment and the entrepreneurial culture in small firms In this article we maintain that the cultural evolution processes of small firms are strongly influenced by the type of relationships that they establish with the economic environment. In the first part of the article, the main points of the discussion are set forth. Here, the theoretical debate is presented and the existing relations between the entrepreneurial culture and the interaction of firms with their economic environment is analyzed. In the second part of the article, the methodologies adopted for the statistical analysis are explained, and the results of the empirical analysis are presented. Finally, in the third part the implications for practitioners, industrial policies, and future directions in research are discussed. The importance of openness to change in the entrepreneurial culture is a basic assumption in this study. It is well known that in small and medium firms, entrepreneurs often demonstrate a resistance to change'' that limits the firm's competitiveness. In some observed territorial and industrial contexts this resistance to change is determined by a cultural entrepreneurial homogeneity. This homogeneity is a result of the similarity of the social, educational and entrepreneurial experiences of the subjects observed. Indeed, the entrepreneurs studied had for generations received the same education, lived in the same area, cmd come from the same social setting. This entrepreneurial culture is typified by distrust of innovation and discontinuity, which leads these entrepreneurs to favor already proven solutions and initiate the behaviors of others, rather than take innovative actions. Principal component analysis has been used to identify the influences that various factors, within and external to the firm, have in the forming of an entrepreneurial culture and thus on the openness of entrepreneurs and firms to learning. In the sample, a trade-off emerged between tendencies to homologous behaviors and the spirit of initiative. Through cluster analysis we identified categories of entrepreneurs with a different propensity to innovation regarding established firm routines. Learning entrepreneurs belong mainly to industries that serve the final consumer while bounded entrepreneurs tend to specialize in commodities more often for export. The implications of our results might interest new entrepreneurs who can include this element when analyzing the viability of new ventures. Small, already operational firms, can evaluate opportunities arising from export processes or might adjust their position on the production filiere To be closer to the final market. This empirical analysis should be reapplied to firms in areas with different environmental characteristics or to production filieres where the relationship between customer and supplier is different, as for example in high-tech-industries, so as to verify whether the intensity of the relations with the market differs according to external factors or the technological intensity of the industries examined.

       " \"The entrepreneurial mindset and self-employment intention of high school learners: The moderating role of family business ownership Entrepreneurship, through successful business venturing, plays a pivotal role in a nation's endeavor to create jobs and boost the economy. The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) reports state that South Africa's early stage total entrepreneurial activity (TEA) is lower than most countries that are at comparable levels of development. Therefore, the entrepreneurial mindset of high school learners and its influence on self-employment intention were assessed in this study. Also, the moderating effect of family business ownership on the relationship was measured. The data collected from 320 learners in randomly selected 10 high schools in Gauteng were analyzed using hierarchical regression analysis. The study finds that the level of an entrepreneurial mindset is above average, which provides the potential for a higher total entrepreneurial activity (TEA) in the future. Both entrepreneurial skills and entrepreneurial traits significantly influence self-employment intention, while learners' family business background moderates the relationship. The study establishes the entrepreneurial mindset level of high school students in a country with one of the lowest TEA in the world, South Africa, where (possibly) the latest entrepreneurial mindset measure, the Entrepreneurial Mindset Profile (EMP) instrument is used. Also, it's unique in testing the role of family business background in intensifying the entrepreneurial mindset toward self-employment intention. Therefore, the Department of Basic Education should aim to tap into the existing desire in high school learners and develop a curriculum that integrates theoretical and experiential learning. It is expected that this intervention will improve the future TEA of the country.\",\n",

       " \"HARNESSING EDUCATION THROUGH ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN CONSUMER STUDIES TO ADDRESS YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT IN SOUTH AFRICA As South Africa has an extremely high youth unemployment rate, entrepreneurship education is vital to provide this country's learners with opportunities for, and insight into, creating their own employment. Such education can be offered using the approaches about, for or through entrepreneurship. Each of these approaches serves a different purpose. This article specifically focusses on education through entrepreneurship, which is deemed best to prepare learners for real-world entrepreneurship. Only one subject in the South African school curriculum (i.e. Consumer Studies) has the advantage of potentially providing education through entrepreneurship. Most Consumer Studies teachers, however, face several challenges in their efforts to ensure that this advantage reaches their learners. These challenges impair teaching and learning in Consumer Studies, demoralise teachers and diminish the potential advantage of the entrepreneurship education embedded in the subject. The subject needs to be fortified to ensure that this unique advantage can be implemented with more frequent success in Consumer Studies. A qualitative exploratory case study was conducted to explore how one selected school had successfully applied education through entrepreneurship in Consumer Studies. Data were collected through qualitative interviews (n=2) with the teachers at this school, as they had managed to successfully fortify Consumer Studies at their school against many of the challenges reported in this subject by teachers at other schools. The data analysis was interpretive, informed by the major challenges that Consumer Studies teachers face in South Africa, as reported in the literature. The findings indicated that the teachers at this school implemented a series of well-planned strategies to generate continuous income for sustaining Consumer Studies. Their successes have contributed to the subject expanding in their school, with increasing numbers of learners who select it, meaning that a growing number of learners will benefit from the entrepreneurship education embedded in Consumer Studies. As a result, a model - with the main aim of supporting and strengthening education through entrepreneurship in this subject - was subsequently developed, which Consumer Studies teachers could use to overcome some of the challenges they face in the subject. Further research is needed to refine the model for different contexts in the South African educational landscape.\",\n",
       " 'The entrepreneurial profile of Brazilian business administration students Purpose This study aims to focus on the entrepreneurial education and profile in undergraduate business administration programs in Brazil, particularly in the southern region of the state of Rio de Janeiro. Assuming that the entrepreneurial profile can be developed by teaching and learning processes. Design/methodology/approach The research performed qualitative approach through interviews and a quantitative approach using multiple criteria decision-making methods. Data were collected along 2015 in a survey with a population of 412 students from three high education institutions (HEIs) and analyzed using the analytic hierarchy process with ratings. Findings The study has found that the key entrepreneurial trait for all groups was the ability to plan. Other relevant dimensions were self-realization, innovative and leader. The dimensions risk taking and sociability were considered not important in the opinion of all groups. Practical implications The entrepreneurial profile does not seem to evolve over the four-year college period, thus suggesting a failure of the entrepreneurial education at the three surveyed HEIs to impact the overall perception of students about the requirements for creating and developing new ventures. Actions to revert this trend should be taken. Originality/value This research aims to identify differences in perception about the entrepreneurial profile among freshmen and senior undergraduates. The theme is relevant in a knowledge era where academy has to prepare students to be entrepreneurs. Similar studies were done around in Brazil and around the world but no one in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The work has a contribution by proposing and applying a method to compare students groups, programs, institutions and countries over time.',\n",
       " \"Assessing the impacts of school entrepreneurial initiatives A quasi-experiment at the elementary school level Purpose Many countries around the world have now introduced entrepreneurship into their curricula and educational practices, starting at the elementary school level. However, recent studies show the relative (un)effectiveness of K-12 enterprise education on diverse learning outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to report on a research aimed at assessing the impacts of enterprise education on students' entrepreneurial attitudes. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a quasi-experiment between May and June 2017 to assess the entrepreneurial potential of students at Elementary Cycle 3 (10-12 years) in Quebec, Canada. Relying on attitude theory, the authors used Athayde's Attitudes toward Enterprise for Young People test, which assesses students' entrepreneurial potential through four entrepreneurial attitudes (leadership, creativity, achievement and personal control). The experimental group consisted of 11 classes which had conducted an entrepreneurial project during the 2016-2017 school year (n = 208 students), while the 7 classes of the control group had not (n=151 students). Findings At first glance, data showed no difference between the two groups. Further investigation showed that private and Freinet (public) schools' students, both from the control group, show significantly higher leadership scores than those of the experimental group. In-depth analyses also show that increasing the number of entrepreneurial projects significantly impacted three of the four attitudes assessed, although negligibly. Research limitations/ implications - Taken together, those results question the relevance of single entrepreneurial activities in developing students' entrepreneurial attitudes. They also suggest the positive impact of a progressive, constructivist pedagogy in developing such entrepreneurial attitudes. Moreover, the paper raises several factors likely to impact students' entrepreneurial attitudes for further research. Originality/value K-12 enterprise education remains an understudied context, largely crossed by unproven statements. This research contributes to understand and give direction to educational initiatives targeting the development of young students' entrepreneurial attitudes.\",\n",
       " \"Teaching technological innovation and entrepreneurship in polymeric biomaterials A model for incorporating an entrepreneurship module has been developed in an upper-division and graduate-level engineering elective on Polymeric Biomaterials (27-311/42-311/27-711/42-711) at Carnegie Mellon University. A combination of lectures, assignments, and a team-based project were used to provide students with a framework for applying their technical skills in the development of new technologies and a basic understanding of the issues related to translational research and technology commercialization. The specific approach to the project established in the course, which represented 20% of the students' grades, and the grading rubric for each of the milestones are described along with suggestions for generalizing this approach to different applications of biomaterials or other engineering electives. Incorporating this model of entrepreneurship into electives teaches students course content within the framework of technological innovation and many of the concepts and tools need to practice it. For students with situational or individual interest in the project, it would also serve to deepen their understanding of the traditional course components as well as provide a foundation for integrating technological innovation and lifelong learning.

       " \"How data analytics is changing entrepreneurial opportunities? Purpose The rise of big data and analytics companies has significantly changed the business playground. Big data and the use of data analytics are being adopted more frequently, especially in companies that are looking for new methods to develop smarter capabilities and tackle challenges in the dynamic processes. Working with big data and applying a series of data analysis techniques require strong multidisciplinary skills and knowledge of statistics, econometrics, computer science, data mining, law and business ethics, etc. Higher education institutions (HEIs) are concerned by this phenomenon which is also changing learning needs and require a reorientation toward the development of novel approaches and advancements in their programs. The purpose of this paper is to introduce and define big data analytics as having an immense potential for generating value for businesses. In this context, one prominent strategy is to integrate big data analytics in educational programs to enrich student' understanding of the role of big data, especially those who want to explore their entrepreneurial ways and improve their effectiveness. So, the main purpose of this article consists, on the one hand, in why HEIs must carefully think about how to provide powerful learning tools and open a new entrepreneurship area in this field, and, why, on the other hand, future entrepreneurs (students) have to use data analytics and how they can integrate, operationally, analytics methods to extract value and enhance their professional capabilities. Design/methodology/approach The author has established an expert viewpoint to discuss the notion of data analytics, identify new ways and re-think what really is new, for both entrepreneurs and HEIs, in the area of big data. This study provides insights into how students can improve their skills and develop new business models through the use of IT tools and by providing the ability to analyze data. This can be possible by bringing the tool of analytics into the higher educational learning system. New analytics methods have to help find new ways to process data and make more intelligent decisions. A brief overview of data analytics and its roles in the context of entrepreneurship and the rise of data entrepreneur is then presented. The paper also outlines the role of educational programs in helping address big data challenges and transform possibilities into opportunities. The key factors of implementing an efficient big data analytics in learning programs, to better orientate and guide students' project idea, are also explored. The paper concludes with suggestions for further research and limitations of the study. Findings The findings in this paper suggest that analytics can be of crucial importance for student entrepreneurial practice if correctly aligned with their business processes and learning needs and can also lead to significant improvement in their performance and quality of the decisions they make. The added value of big data is the ability to identify useful data and turn it into usable information by identifying patterns and exploiting new algorithms, tools and new project solutions. So, the move toward the introduction of big data and analytics tools in higher education addresses how this new opportunity can be operationalized. Research limitations/implications There are some limitations to this research paper. The research findings have significant implications for HEIs in the field of analytics (mathematics and computer science), and thus, it is not generalizable with any further context. Also, the viewpoint is centered on the data analytics process as a value generator for entrepreneurial opportunities. Originality/value This research can be considered as a contribution with literature about educational quality, entrepreneurship and big data analytics. This study describes that new analytics thinking and computational skills are needed for the newer generation of entrepreneurs to handle the challenges of big data. But, preparing them to capture, analyze, store and manage the large amounts of data available today - so they can see value in data - is not just about implementing and using new technologies. This is also, about, a dynamic, operational and modern educational learning process from which a student can extract the maximum benefit. In another words: How to make new opportunities from these data? Which data to select for the analysis? and How to efficiently apply analytical techniques to generate value?\",\n",
       " \"Creating innovative entrepreneurial mindsets as a lever for knowledge-based regional development Regional development in the knowledge-based economy is not just determined by the creation of new knowledge but also by the ability and willingness to transform this knowledge into new products and processes that create economic and social value. Improving this entrepreneurial mindset in human capital is becoming one of the most important challenges to raising innovation, productivity and regional growth. With the aim to provide a contribution in this direction, the paper presents an innovative curriculum model to sustain the development of the entrepreneurial mind set especially in engineers and scientists. Based on an ongoing experiment with five education projects launched by a technological district located in south Italy, the preliminary results emphasise the role of an entrepreneurial-directed approach based on the phases of developing, managing and growing new 'technology intensive' ventures. Implications for theory and practices highlight the strategies for designing entrepreneurial learning programs that could support the creation of knowledge-intensive entrepreneurship for regional development, mainly in those regions where entrepreneurship does not arise spontaneously.\",\n",
       " 'Monkey see, monkey do? Examining the effect of entrepreneurial orientation and knowledge sharing on new venture creation for Gen Y and Gen Z Purpose This study aims to examine the effect of entrepreneurial intention and attitude towards knowledge sharing on new business creation by comparing two generations, Y generation (millennials) and Z generation (post-millennial). In addition, the current study uses a social cognitive theory as a point of departure to test the research hypotheses. Design/methodology/approach This study deploys a quantitative approach (hypothetic-deductive approach) by surveying 300 respondents representing the two Indonesian generations. The questionnaire consisting of demographic items (age, education, etc.) and variables was the primary research instrument. This study used regression analysis, a Wald test for examining the proposed hypotheses and a t-test to provide a deeper analysis of the findings. Findings Findings from the current study show that Gen Y is still seeking a balance for their learning sources by involving in their social environments as well as exploring the digital world. In contrast, Gen Z is much more dominant in the independence to learn things that interest them. They have less dependency on social patrons but prioritise themselves as the leading model. Practical implications The findings of this study provide practical implications for higher education institutions in the development of entrepreneurship education to achieve learning effectiveness. Originality/value This study aims to contribute by providing empirical evidence in the effect of entrepreneurial orientation and attitude towards knowledge sharing on new venture creation with particular reference to Gen Y and Gen Z, suggested by previous studies. Although Gen Y and Gen Z are digital natives, this study provides insight into a shift in the characteristic of two generations, as also found in comparison to previous generations, such as Baby-Boomer vs Gen X and Gen X vs Gen Y. This study proclaims the need to adjust organisational theories to enable them to explain the shifting phenomena at the micro and macro level for every generation. Exploratory research to better understand the characteristics of a generation in other settings is a crucial proposal proposed by this study.',\n",
       " \"Evaluating the impact of serious games: the effect of gaming on entrepreneurial intent Purpose - Serious games are playing an increasingly significant role across a range of educational contexts. Business focused serious games can provide students with an authentic learning experience and their use has been increasingly taken up by business school faculty, including those delivering entrepreneurship education (EE). The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impact of participation in a serious business game on the entrepreneurial intent (EI) of undergraduate students. Design/methodology/approach - The study adopts a pre-test/post-test quasi-experimental design. It employs a modified version of Linan et al.'s (2011) EI model in the form of a questionnaire survey completed by 263 undergraduate business and management students. Findings - A logic regression model was used to analyse the survey responses. The research findings indicate that the serious game used in this study has a significant negative impact on EI. Gender and role model effects are also identified from the analysis. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the literature in two ways. First, it demonstrates the impact of serious business games on EI during the enterprise awareness stage of a student's EE. Second, it provides a foundation for exploring the role that serious games can play in educating the potential entrepreneurs of the future.\",\n",
       " \"The interplay between market need urgency, entrepreneurial push and pull insights and opportunity confidence in the course of new venture creation in the developing country context This study investigates the complex relationships between market need urgency (MNU), entrepreneurial push and pull insights driven by supply (SDI) and demand (DDI), and opportunity confidence (OC), resulting in new venture creation (NVC) from the perspective of nascent entrepreneur's perceptions in the developing country context. Departing from the discovery and creation views of the entrepreneurial process, it builds on the seminal works of Sarasvathy et al. (2003) and Dimov (2007a) to examine how demand- and supply-driven insights and opportunity confidence are related, especially when nascent entrepreneurs think there is urgency for a specific need in a developing country marketplace. Using binary logistic regressions, we test the research hypotheses on a dataset of nascent entrepreneurs who were traced for four years. We find that the MNU is a subtle predictor of NVC, both directly and indirectly through OC. We also find that OC is a crucial element in accelerating entrepreneurial activity, either when there is a market need urgency or the entrepreneur has a firm opinion about the markets and technologies related to a specific product/service. The results suggest that nascent entrepreneurs operate by their perceptions of markets and technologies, yet their confidence levels play a major role in moving onto the stage of new venture creation. Furthermore, results suggest that nascent entrepreneurs' market and technology-related entrepreneurial insights, opportunity confidence, and their co-existence in distinct settings such as isolated third world countries are relatively new phenomena that require deeper investigation. Finally, this research provides implications that give entrepreneurship educators, practitioners, and policymakers informed choices to encourage entrepreneurial learning and experiencing processes specifically in higher education settings in developing countries.\",\n",
       " 'Spirituality and entrepreneurship: integration of spiritual beliefs in an entrepreneurial journey Purpose The role of spirituality in entrepreneurship is a new area of inquiry that has emerged from different scholarly fields. There is no specific way to study spirituality as it rather depends on the context and influence of religious beliefs. This paper aims to study the integration of spirituality in the entrepreneurial journeys of individual entrepreneurs in Pakistan. Thereby focusing on the factors that set reassurance for entrepreneurs to practice their spiritual beliefs in an emerging market context. Design/methodology/approach Using a qualitative research approach and data from entrepreneurs in different businesses, this study examines how entrepreneurs reach the point where they are willing to run their businesses based on their spiritual beliefs. The data analysis technique used to study the entrepreneurs is the Gioia method of analysis, which enables key themes to emerge. Findings This study finds that the process through which Pakistani entrepreneurs run their businesses based on spiritual beliefs within their mission and goals can be considered as discerning spiritual beliefs, affirmation of spiritual beliefs and materializing beliefs into action. Each of these spiritual beliefs has been accumulated through lifelong learning and experience in which trust in business relationships is highlighted. Social implications The insights of this study can be applied to different entrepreneurial ventures to create a framework of entrepreneurial businesses that incorporate spirituality within their mission and vision statements. It can then be used to design education and training activities for other spiritual entrepreneurs to enable further entrepreneurial development in different communities. Originality/value Spirituality can alter the entrepreneurial nature of a business. This means that entrepreneurs who possess high spiritual beliefs can incorporate their spirituality within specific business functions to enable a more positive outcome. This study stands as the first in Pakistan to consider the ways entrepreneurs incorporate their spiritual beliefs in their entrepreneurial journey.',\n",
       " \"Fostering entrepreneurial innovation ecosystems: lessons learned from the European Institute of Innovation and Technology While business practices and management research has evolved towards more systemic approaches building on the notion of ecosystem to relate organisations with their complex operational environment, the linear model of innovation is still highly pervasive in governmental innovation policies. In this paper we contribute to the narrowing the research gap in the field on ecosystems by combining two often separate streams of literature and subsequently coining the term 'entrepreneurial innovation ecosystems'. We then examine the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), a recent policy experiment aimed at developing Pan-European ecosystems to stimulate high-impact innovative entrepreneurship, which is done by integrating higher education, research and business activities (i.e. via knowledge triangle integration). While the high political profile of the EIT has constrained partly its freedom to experiment, a European-wide networked excellence and business logic in managing KICs has created new insights on experimental governance models that merit to be explored further. Building on an action research case study, the paper documents these developments and opens up an avenue for further work regarding experimental governance of Pan-European entrepreneurial innovation ecosystems.\",\n",
       " 'Assessment of Entrepreneurship Competencies Through the Use of FLIGBY Serious games are increasingly being used as innovative tool for developing entrepreneurial skills, such as strategic management, leadership, communication, negotiation or decision making. FLIGBY is a serious game that was initially developed with the objective of simulating the business management process and the application of Flow theory in a business context. However, most recently it has been suggested that serious games in general, and FLIGBY in particular, can be used in other contexts, namely in the development of entrepreneurial skills. In this sense, this study tries to verify if the competences developed and evaluated in FLIGBY on the Master Analytics Profiler (MAP) can be used to evaluate the entrepreneurial capacities of the students in the context of the course of entrepreneurship in a higher education institution. The findings indicate that the performance of these students in FLIGBY is very similar to the benchmark with only small oscillations. However, some asymmetries emerged considering the educational and professional experience, such that the students of the management course showed better business-oriented thinking and IT students revealed greater time-management skills. Finally, professional experience has proved to be relevant for making decisions about stress and for the completion of managerial tasks successfully.',\n",

In this context, policy-makers and organizations are increasingly interested in fostering entrepreneurial competences to improve the success of policies and venture capital investments. This paper aims at identifying the core relevant entrepreneurial competences, mapping the current literature and the main clusters and going beyond toward a meta-competence framework. Design/methodology/approach The research approach is a literature review, combining bibliometric, network and content analysis. The sampling process was conducted in the Scopus and Web of Science databases. The bibliometrics and content analysis were performed with a computer aid approach applying VosViewer1.6, Ucinet and NetDraw 2.139. The content analysis approach was performed considering a detailed coding schema developed. Finally, toward the meta-competences framework, the study applied quantitative analysis on the coding schema, particularly cross-tabulation, core-periphery and network analysis. Findings The results show the state of the art concerning entrepreneurial competences. The research identified a list of 98 entrepreneurial competences. Finally, the study proposes a meta-competence framework and clusters the 33 core entrepreneurial competences previously identified. Originality/value The proposed conceptual framework exploring meta-entrepreneurial competences offers an original contribution with implications for theory and practice. The research contributes to broadening the understanding of the entrepreneurial competences, helping on the creation, design, development and improvement of entrepreneurship educational initiatives, which are important to entrepreneurs' educators. The proposed framework contributes by providing relevant knowledge for the policy-makers' strategy formulation processes. As implications for the practice, the proposed framework can allow better assessment process for incubators and accelerators, besides more robust ventures considering learning trails based on meta-competences frameworks.\",\n",

Design/methodology/approach To understand the challenges faced, data was collected from entrepreneurship students and entrepreneurship educators through focus group discussions. The study followed Kitzinger (1995) as data was analyzed in its entirety as a group and then individually. Groups and individuals were the focus of the analysis. The study applies the Kepner Trego problem analysis technique (KPTA) as the problem-solving technique adopted by the institute and SAP-LAP (situation, actor, process, learning, action, performance) to discuss the findings of the study. Findings The study found that to engage, encourage and enable students to study on their start-up/business ideas; it is important to facilitate peer interactions, internships in start-ups and meaningful engagement with alumni entrepreneurs. Some proactive interventions are also expected from institutes to energize the student community with positivity. It is also important to nurture the emotional well-being of budding entrepreneurs. Research limitations/implications The case study narrates the innovative and agile problem-solving approach of the business school during the pandemic. KPTA focuses more on appreciative dialogue and also helps to replicate the best from other situations to the problem areas. SAP-LAP method also helps practitioners to initiate the right new actions with targeted performance. Practical implications As a greater number of academic institutions impart entrepreneurship education today, the findings of the study would be relevant to the stakeholders, including students, educators and institutes.

       " \"Entrepreneurship education and graduate's venture creation activities: roles of entrepreneurial support and entrepreneurial capabilities This study addresses problems of graduate's unemployment by providing directions on how graduates can utilize entrepreneurship for self-reliance through venture creation (VEC) activities. This follows understanding that most governments have implemented the teaching of entrepreneurship education (EDU; learning, inspiration, incubation resource), which is occasioned with entrepreneurial support (ESP) programs, to equip students with entrepreneurial capabilities (ECP) required to carry-out VEC activities. Therefore, the study examined the implication of EDU on VEC through the mediating and moderating roles of ECP and ESP among Nigerian graduates. Conducting the study using the formative approach with 291 survey responses, the result of partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) showed that ECP has a complementary mediating effect on the relationship between EDU and VEC, while the moderating role of ESP in relation to ECP and VEC was found to be negative but significant. Implying not all instances of EDU will result in VEC through ECP because EDU can directly lead to VEC, while the positive effect of ECP on VEC becomes weaker and negative at higher ESP. Limitations of the study were based on design, but future researches considering using control variables or conducting longitudinal survey and extending the population were proposed. The study found support for validating EDU and VEC as reflective-formative second-order constructs, which added theoretical and practical contributions in the EDU and VEC scholarships. Some recommendations were drawn based on findings suggesting intervention agencies to administer effective ESPs, covering both financial, non-financial, and incubation resources needed to strengthened graduate's VEC activities.\",\n",
       " \"Transformational Entrepreneurship and Digital Platforms: A Combination of ISM-MICMAC and Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms For many years, entrepreneurs were considered the change agents of their societies. They use their initiative and innovative minds to solve problems and create value. In the aftermath of the digital transformation era, a new group of entrepreneurs have emerged who are called transformational entrepreneurs. They use various digital platforms to create value. Surprisingly, despite their importance, they have not been sufficiently investigated. Therefore, this research scrutinizes the elements affecting transformational entrepreneurship in digital platforms. To do so, the authors have considered a two-phase method. First, interpretive structural modeling (ISM) and Matrices d'Impacts Croises Multiplication Applique a Un Classement (MICMAC) are used to suggest a model. ISM is a qualitative method to reach a visualized hierarchical structure. Then, four unsupervised machine learning algorithms are used to ensure the accuracy of the proposed model. The findings reveal that transformational leadership could mediate the relationship between the entrepreneurial mindset and thinking and digital transformation, interdisciplinary approaches, value creation logic, and technology diffusion. The GMM in the full type, however, has the best accuracy among the various covariance types, with an accuracy of 0.895. From the practical point of view, this paper provides important insights for practitioners, entrepreneurs, and public actors to help them develop transformational entrepreneurship skills. The results could also serve as a guideline for companies regarding how to manage the consequences of a crisis such as a pandemic. The findings also provide significant insight for higher education policymakers.\",\n",

       " \"Israeli women entrepreneurs: An examination of factors affecting performance This article examines individual factors influencing performance of 200 Israeli women-owned businesses. Whereas research on women entrepreneurs is extensive in developed countries, especially in the United States and Europe, there are comparatively Sew studies of performance of women-owned businesses in non-OECD countries. There is evidence that social structures (work, family, and organized social life) vary among developed and developing countries as these relate to women entrepreneurs. However; these differences have not been considered as they may relate to theories explaining performance elf women-owned businesses. The extent to which existing theories are useful in the context of non-OECD countries is of increasing importance as women ii? these countries are assuming a greater role in enterprise creation and economic development as a result of radical geopolitical and economic policy changes worldwide. In Israel, women stiffer from occupational segregation and typically earn less money than their male counterparts, despite a generally high level of education. Entrepreneurship offers a vehicle for Israeli women to achieve economic parity. Approximately 5.1% of Israeli women are self-employed (compared with 15% of Israeli men) of the 816, 800 Israeli working women. Th is study is the first systematic investigation of performance variation among Israeli women entrepreneurs, thereby contributing to our understanding of women's entrepreneurship in non-OECD countries. Five theoretical perspectives explain performance: individual motivations and goals; social learning (entrepreneurial socialization); network affiliation (contacts and membership in organizations); human capital (level of education, business skills); and environmental influences (location, sectoral participation, and sociopolitical variables). Each of these perspectives is associated with empirical work showing relationships between these individual level factors and performance. Three questions directed this study: (1) Which factors influence the performance of Israeli women entrepreneurs? (2) Which factors explain any variance in performance among businesses established by Israeli women entrepreneurs? (3) How similar are these explanatory)t factors to those found in other countries? A sample of 220 Israeli women business-owners responded to a survey instrument originally composed by Hisrich and Brush (1982, 1985) that was translated into Hebrew and adapted to the particular conditions of the Israeli population. A majority of the questionnaires was distributed at meetings of professional associates of women entrepreneurs and returned by mail, but one-fourth was distributed to women who were not members of any professional association. No significant differences were found between the respondents who were members or non-members of associations. Reliability tearing showed alpha coefficients of 0.65 and higher for scaled questions,,which is acceptable for survey darn. Statistical analyses, including Pearsons's correlations and multiple regressions, examined relationships between factors identified from theoretical perspectives and performance, which was measured by profitability, income, size (number of employees), and revenues. Demographic variables were examined, and the age of the woman entrepreneur's children wets significantly related to profitability (p <.01). The majority of Israeli women entrepreneurs are married and became entrepreneurs after their children were grown. This is consistent with the strong family orientation prevalent in the Israeli culture and the existence of institutional arrangements that support the working ,mother model as long as she gives priority to family responsibilities. Of the five theoretical perspectives, results showed network affiliation, motivation, human capital, and environmental factors affected different aspects of performance, whereas social learning theory or existence of a role model had no significant effect on performance outcomes. Network affiliation was significantly related to profitability (p <.001), and die use of outside advisors also was related to revenue. fn contrast, participation in multiple networks was negatively related to revenue, income, and size of the business. Motivations showed a strong relationship to performance. Factor analysis identified three basic groups of motives: achievement, independence, and economic necessity. Similar to findings in other countries, achievement motives were highly related to personal income, whereas economic necessity was significantly related to both profitability and revenue. Analyses of human capital variables showed mixed results; education level; areas of study, and previous entrepreneurial experience had no effect on previous experience. The fact that this population was highly educated (51% had university degrees) may, have impacted on this result Consistent with prior research findings, previous experience in the industry had a direct and significant effect on performance (p <.001). Previous salaried employment and involvement in the creation of a business were significantly; correlated with sales and number of employees. Results also showed that indexes of women women entrepreneurs' business skills (obtaining financing, budgeting, labor management, and planning ahead) were highly correlated with revenues (p <.01). Regression analysis showed the business skill index significantly related to profitability (p <.01). Environmental factors were significantly related to performance in that the sectoral affiliation (service versus manufacturing) was related ro revenues and employees, but nor to profitability and income. This study supports previous research from the United States and Europe an women entrepreneurs, which found that performance is related to previous industry experience, business skills, and achievement motivation. However, the differential effects of network affiliations was significantly more important for women entrepreneurs in Israel. Affiliation with a single network was highly related to profitability, whereas involvement in multiple networks was detrimental to both revenues and the number of employees. These findings imply that to perform well, Israeli women entrepreneurs should gain related industry experience develop business skills, and seek to achieve success. Most importantly, commitment to a single ,network for support and advice is better than a loose alignment with many support groups. This research has implications for studies of women entrepreneurs in other non-OECD as well as developing countries. In countries such as Russia or China, anecdotal evidence shows self-employment offers women an opportunity to improve their economic status as more capitalistic policies are adopted The extent to which individual factors found important in this study, such as business skills, motivations, previous industry experience, and network affiliation, affect performance in these countries is a topic for future investigation. This study suggests that individual factors affect performance differentially as a consequence of variations in social structures, work organized social life, and family. Future research should explore the extent to which this is the case. Examination of aspects of organizational strategies and government policies as these influence performance is another topic for future study. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.\",\n",

However, in the case of Oman, where this study was conducted, little or no research has been conducted, to date, to explore the perceptions of students and faculty members regarding the entrepreneurship-oriented courses they participate in, which is a serious gap in the literature. This study aims to fill this gap by examining the beliefs and conceptions that learners and faculty at a private HEI in Muscat, Oman, had about the course entitled Entrepreneurship and New Venture Creation (ENVC). Design/methodology/approach The primary and secondary research questions are addressed using a mixed-methods approach that includes an online student questionnaire answered by 110 students who had studied the ENVC course, a focus group discussion with eight students facilitated by MS Teams and semi-structured interviews with two faculty members. Findings The findings revealed that the study participants had a very positive view of the ENVC course discussed here as they pointed to several benefits, including improved knowledge of business and entrepreneurship concepts, increased familiarity with the local business environment, development of entrepreneurial intention and improvement of their critical thinking, creativity and innovation skills. In addition, the results revealed some concerns among the participating students, particularly regarding the lack of adequate training sessions on risk management and financial planning. The participants also requested hands-on experience through industrial entrepreneurship training and in-residence-entrepreneurship programs. Research limitations/implications This study raises a number of possibilities for further research on this type of course in terms of students' employability skills, know-how and agency when the time comes for them to enter the real world of business and employment. Future work would benefit from using a longitudinal survey on a group of alumni to triangulate and compare the various findings that were reached here. It would certainly be even more fruitful if conducted at two or more HEIs and with larger population samples to ensure broad coverage, representation and generalization. Work along these lines would certainly refine and extend our findings. Practical implications This study has significant pedagogical implications for future graduate students seeking employment, entrepreneurship course developers and faculty. Relatively, the educational outcomes of entrepreneurship education will also rely on the way entrepreneurship is being taught to students. It is recommended that entrepreneurship teaching should focus on cognitive development and active implementation of in-house incubation for well-planned innovative business ideas. This will provide opportunities for students to gain real-life experiences and identify their strengths and weaknesses, as well as the areas and skills that need to be maintained; hence, further research on the effectiveness of in-house incubation could best be considered for the next study. Another concern raised in this study is the lack of training in financial planning. Hence, further research can be considered on how to improve the financial planning skills of students for a start-up journey. Social implications This course is designed in alignment with Oman Vision 2040, which places great emphasis on entrepreneurship as it plays an important role in the planned economic diversification and sustainability, in which innovation derived from entrepreneurship development will be used as the main driver for the development of infrastructure and educational systems that encourage entrepreneurship. Moreover, the ENVC course focuses on the concept of social entrepreneurship. It inculcates a sense of responsibility for supporting the immediate society among students. Learning the perceptions of students and teachers will provide opportunities to achieve their academic goals, which will reap economic and financial returns in the long run. The development of entrepreneurial skills and intentions of students will eventually help in boosting the country's economy and its social fabric, thus improving the overall quality of life of Omani society. Originality/value Even though this study is an exploratory investigation, the framework sets out clear empirical insights into the entrepreneurship course development, its main contents, assessments and learners' and faculty members' perceptions of the design, intent, content and delivery of the ENVC course and has crucial implications for all the stakeholders. The originality of this case study lies in the fact that it is the first of its kind in the body of research as it links theory to practice and will be a useful reference for entrepreneurship course developers, higher education faculty and students.\",\n",
       " \"IS THERE A NEXUS BETWEEN SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND THE EMPLOYABILITY OF GRADUATES? Social entrepreneurs have, in several ways, been regarded as engines of intense socioeconomic development. They are also famous for intervening with projects for society's problems that are often either inadvertently ignored or inadequately managed by mainstream society. The issue of graduate employability has gained increased tension around the world especially in emerging markets such as South Africa. Currently, suggestions are that considering the avowed contribution of social entrepreneurs, it may be worthwhile to start examining how they can assist with graduate employability in South Africa. This paper, therefore, takes an exploratory yet focused scrutiny of the social entrepreneurship ecosystem to find out the likelihood of social entrepreneurs participating in programs that prepare students for the workplace, thereby reducing graduate unemployability. This is a conceptual paper that has benefitted from an extensive review of literature. Conclusions are drawn therefrom to suggest that opportunities exist for social entrepreneurs to provide practical, project-based learning opportunities for college and university students so that by the time they graduate, they have attained reasonable work-readiness levels that stand them in good stead for employment. While the authors propose an intensive empirical study of the subject matter, we are equally positive that this paper may be used to advance the current platforms of engagement of the role of social entrepreneurs or grow innovative methods that provide graduates with a better chance to be successful in the working environment. In short, this paper calls for sustained discussions on how social entrepreneurs can improve graduate employability.\",\n",
       " \"The Influence of Demographical Factors on the Interaction between Entrepreneurship and Unemployment Lithuania has made a significant progress on institution-building and policymaking in support of entrepreneurship over the last ten years (Grundey et al., 2008); however, the constantly changing business environment, information-flow growth, processes of integration into the global market increase business risk, and this complicates the people's determination to start their own business (Remeikiene, Startiene, 2007; Voronova, 2008), because business itself cannot provide the projected free cash flow (Kazlauskiene, Christauskas, 2007); a business establishment is limited by the lack of financial support measures for the start ups and developments of small and medium-sized businesses (Tamosiunas, Lukosius, 2009); in order to survive in the market, firms are not only forced to recognize business risks, but must learn to manage them (Savcuk 2007). A person determined to become an entrepreneur must evaluate not only the external, but also personal circumstances. The article deals with an actual problem - the influence of demographical factors on the interaction between entrepreneurship and unemployment. The interaction between the entrepreneurship and unemployment is mainly analyzed through the two-way relationship between entrepreneurship and unemployment. The authors of studies (Thurik, 2003; Thurik, Verheul, 2002; Stel, Stunnberg, 2004; Audretsch, Carey, Thurik, 2002; Care, Stella, Thurik Audretsch, 2007) found that this relationship exists in the countries such as Japan, OECD countries. While studying the interaction between entrepreneurship and unemployment in other countries (Portugal, Spain, United Kingdom), the conclusion was made that economic analysis is insufficient in order to determine the bonds between them, it is necessary to analyze and evaluate all the chain of factors (cultural, demographic, political, psychological, technological)which determine the mutual relations between entrepreneurship and unemployment By the purpose of the article - the evaluation of the influence of demographical factors on the interaction between entrepreneurship and unemployment - the authors seek to show how demographic factors affect the development of entrepreneurship and reduce unemployment. Lithuanian and foreign scientists, examining the influence demographic factors on the entrepreneurship and unemployment, pays the highest attention to such demographic characteristics as gender, age, education, emigration, ethnic minorities, race, marital status, as they may determine the success of the business creation/survival or reduce the duration unemployment period The research provides interesting facts: individual demographic factors do not always positively influence entrepreneurship/unemployment It appears that the same factors may hinder the establishment of a business, or liberation from unemployment. The question is: why do the demographic factors explored have a twofold influence? Literature does not issue unambiguous answer, but the dual impact of demographic factors is based on the cultures of different countries, their political decisions,, traditions, climate difference or diversity of business fields. Deeper analysis of the interaction between entrepreneurship and unemployment through the prism of the demographical factors was encouraged by the fact that scientists tend to analyze only the effects of demographic factors on entrepreneurship, i.e. the significance of age, education, gender, ethnic minorities and others to business creation. There is the lack of studies which examine demographic factors with interpretation of the mutual bonds of entrepreneurship and unemployment. A systematic analysis of the literature leads to the conclusion that such demographic factors as one of parents'/spouse's being an entrepreneur, emigration, ethnic minorities, race and work experience encourage business creation, while the gender differences - hampers business. Moreover, the demographic factors (education, age, unemployment duration) were determined to affect the start ups of businesses differently. In practical part of the article Pearson's correlation and regression methods were used to examine the reliability presumptions raised. The conclusion was made that education of unemployed men as well as women significantly correlates with the indicator of the relation between the number of established companies with a ratio of the number of operating companies (R-men(2) = 0.74; R-women(2) = 0.77), education of unemployed women - with the number of newly registered enterprises (R-women(2) = 0.71), experience of unemployment - with the indicator of relation between the number of established companies and the number of operating companies (R-1-2(2) (months) = 0.81; R-3-5months(2) = 0.76) and experience of unemployment with the number of newly registered companies (R-1-2(2) (months) = 0.75). This shows that these factors are significant in incorporation of new companies as well as in existing business.\",\n",
       " 'Dyslexic Entrepreneurs: The Incidence; Their Coping Strategies and Their Business Skills This comparative study explores the incidence of dyslexia in entrepreneurs, corporate managers and the general population. It examines the suggestion that dyslexic entrepreneurs develop coping strategies to manage their weaknesses, which are subsequently of benefit in the new venture creation process. Results of this study suggest that there is a significantly higher incidence of dyslexia in entrepreneurs than in the corporate management and general US and UK populations and some of the strategies they adopt to overcome dyslexia (such as delegation of tasks) may be useful in business. The study was undertaken in two parts. First, entrepreneurs and corporate managers completed an online questionnaire, which combined questions about their company, their management or leadership role and their business skills together with questions that were designed to explore the likely incidence of dyslexia. A follow-up study that made use of a semi-structured. questionnaire explored business issues and educational experience in more depth with those who had been diagnosed as dyslexic and those who did not have any history of dyslexia or any other learning difficulty.

       " \"Leader-member exchange theory and its relationship to teachers' intrapreneurial behaviour, teachers' work engagement and entrepreneurial orientation The current study aimed to explore how the relationship between teachers and their principals (leader-member exchange - LMX) promotes intrapreneurial behaviours (i.e., entrepreneurial and innovative activities within existing organisations). The hypotheses were tested using paper-based surveys and scales distributed to 105 teachers. Findings indicated that the relationship between teachers and school principals (LMX) was significantly positively associated with intrapreneurial activities. A high quality relationship was also connected to entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and mediated by the teachers' work engagement. In addition, EO mediated between LMX, work engagement and intrapreneurial activities. In addition, four different machine learning algorithms were used to evaluate the hypotheses by classifying the study data. Naive Bayes was found to outperform logistic regression and the other classification methods. This study is one of the few to explore intrapreneurial behaviour in educational institutions and thus contributes to theory and practice in understanding how innovation behaviours take place in schools, and its implications for the education arena.\",\n",
       " \"Social Entrepreneurs as Role Models for Innovative Professional Career Developments Through qualitative analysis, this paper examines the role of social entrepreneurs as an example of innovative and alternative professional career development. We review the dominant literature about social entrepreneurs' distinct intentions, attitudes, abilities, and behaviors. We also directly connect social entrepreneurs' biographies and discourses with the actual nature of their social enterprises. We have found some fundamental common factors as critical determinants of the final social entrepreneurial decision and result: (i) motivations such as emotional connection, moral judgment, personal dissatisfaction, purpose achievement and change, and social needs; (ii) personal internal resources such as connection skills, conviction, creativity, efficiency skills, and learning orientation; (iii) facilitating external factors such as financial and social support, higher and social education, relevant past events, and previous professional experience. Putting together all these factors, we develop a theoretical framework that can explain social entrepreneurship as an alternative career option and connect it with a dominant social entrepreneur's narrative and profile.\",\n",
       " \"The Impact of New Entrepreneurial Spirit on Cultivating Entrepreneurial Values and Entrepreneurial Ability of College Students The objectives were to deeply study the impact of new entrepreneurial spirit on the cultivation of entrepreneurial values and entrepreneurial ability of college students. First, the influencing factors of college students' entrepreneurial values were analyzed based on new media, entrepreneurial spirit, entrepreneurial values, and other related theories. Second, the corresponding questionnaire was designed and elaborated on the four aspects of college students' entrepreneurial values, namely, entrepreneurial competence, entrepreneurial risk, and entrepreneurial ethics. Finally, the data results of the questionnaire were studied. The results show that in entrepreneurial values of college students, they believe that entrepreneurship is the most important for personal development, with an overall average of 3.86. In the point of view of entrepreneurial competence, they think that independent learning ability plays a significant role in entrepreneurship, with an average of 3.91. In the view of entrepreneurial ethics, they consider that the law is the most crucial during the entrepreneurial, with an average value of 4.35. It means that college students still have certain legal knowledge. After analyzing the results of the questionnaire on entrepreneurial factors, it is found that college students lack social experience and have a low ability to take risks. Meanwhile, entertainment is the first choice for college students on new media platforms, and the time of viewing is more than 5 h/day. Therefore, the influence of new entrepreneurial spirit is researched on the cultivation of entrepreneurial values and entrepreneurial ability of college students, which provides a new theoretical basis and optimization direction for entrepreneurial education in universities in the future.\",\n",
       " \"Rural communities as a context for entrepreneurship: Exploring perceptions of youth and business owners In light of declining rural economies and dissipating rural populations, scholars, policy makers and program developers have increasingly looked to local business development and entrepreneurship as a means of revitalizing small communities across the United States. This study explores the perceptions of youth and business owners regarding the unique challenges and benefits or rural contexts for entrepreneurship, as well as perceptions regarding the potential role of youth in contributing to rural economies. Drawing from in-depth interviews and focus groups among local business owners and young rural residents, findings support earlier research regarding structural challenges that hamper rural business development (e.g., weak infrastructure) but also shed light on social challenges brought about by small and tightly bonded communities (e.g., openness to unfamiliar businesses). Notwithstanding these challenges, findings also suggest several perceived benefits of small communities such as local support for residents' enterprises and ease of communication with one's customer base. Finally, business owners expressed placing a high value on rural youth and their potential to make unique contributions to business development, nonetheless, found challenges around providing meaningful hands-on experiences for youth to learn about business operations.\",\n",
       " 'Why should banks provide entrepreneurship training seminars? This article examines an apparent contradiction at the heart of the provision of management training and advice for new and small firms. Assessments using self-report data show high levels of satisfaction, implying that the training/advice is effective and appreciated. In contrast, assessments using robust statistical methods point to modest, or even zero, impact upon firm performance. Accordingly, our core research question explores whether there is an identifiable performance benefit of management training or whether impact is limited to emotional attachment to the training provider - reflected in enhanced loyalty. We test this by examining the effects of a bank seminar provided for new enterprises and find it had no significant effects on either the survival or sales growth of participants. However, those new enterprises who participated in the seminar were significantly less likely to switch to a rival bank, implying the seminars may have induced a feeling of loyalty among clients. Finally, we discuss the implications for theory, for the bank and for the providers of training for new and small firms more widely.',\n",
       " \"An impact of demographic profile of undergraduate students on the entrepreneurial knowledge and intention in Tamil Nadu, India An intention has a great impact on the actual behaviour of a person. Intention is a state of mind that directs the attitude, potential, learning, experience and action of a person towards a specific goal. The intention to become an entrepreneur is the sole best prognosticator of entrepreneurial behaviour. Entrepreneurship is all about to one's own business that involves one's self-reliance, work attitude, innovation, initiative, creativity and risk-taking. Entrepreneurial knowledge and intention therefore envisages entrepreneurial behaviours. Demographic factors have a great influence on a person's intentions and goal setting. Based upon this the present study aims to analyse the impact of demographic factors on the entrepreneurial intention among the undergraduate students in Tamil Nadu, India. Weighted average analysis, analysis of variance and regression analysis will be employed to find out the relationship between demographic factors and their impact on entrepreneurial intentions. Further this study also aims at finding out the important demographic factors that contribute towards the entrepreneurial intentions of the students. The result of the study can be used in framing course content for the students with the objective of enhancing their entrepreneurial intention and skills.\",\n",
       " \"A Novel Innovation and Entrepreneurship (I&E) Training Program for Biomedical Research Trainees Problem Contemporary science emphasizes efficient translation of scientific discoveries into tangible, innovative products and services to improve human health. Therefore, researchers need skills in innovation and entrepreneurship (I&E) to select which problems to address and bring to market the most promising solutions. Training in this skillset is not currently available to most biomedical research trainees. Approach The Entrepreneurship for Biomedicine (E4B) training program was created to develop biomedical researchers' I&E skills. The program comprises 2 semester-length courses: E4B1 teaches core skills; E4B2 focuses on advanced skills for those interested in pursuing funding for a new venture. In addition to traditional entrepreneurship training, E4B teaches ethics and personal skills such as resilience, communication, and team-building. Each course is delivered online and requires about 4 hours weekly. Program elements include short videos for didactic content; a team-based capstone project; mentorship from experienced entrepreneurs; and a live, virtual pitch presentation. The program is housed at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and is open to pre- and postdoctoral biomedical research trainees and faculty nationwide. Outcomes In 2020, 77 trainees completed E4B1 and 13 went on to complete E4B2. Trainees in both courses were satisfied with learning content and mentorship and would recommend the program to a friend. Pre- and postanalyses demonstrated that trainees' confidence in their knowledge about and ability to perform I&E tasks taught throughout the program increased. Since completion, 4 graduates have received external funding for an innovation and 3 have started a company. Next Steps E4B is well accepted, and this preliminary evaluation suggests the program is effective. It could serve to support medical school curricula, business competitions, and technology transfer efforts, which are opportunities for future exploration. A more robust evaluation is planned and recruitment will be expanded to increase participation from women and underrepresented populations.\",\n",
       " \"The effect of entrepreneur mentoring and its determinants in the Chinese context Purpose - Entrepreneurial mentoring is widely regarded as an effective way to train novice entrepreneurs all over the world. However, the effectiveness of this approach and the determinants are not well understood under country-specific conditions. The purpose of this paper is to build a conceptual framework and use empirical analysis to explore the mentoring effect and its determinants, especially in the Chinese context. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses data from 172 young entrepreneurs which had been supported by Youth Business China, Mianyang Office since 2008. The factor analysis and structural equation model have been applied to analyze the data to investigate the quantitative relationship and path of the mentoring effect of entrepreneurship with mentor's factors, young entrepreneurs (mentees's factors) and their interrelationship. Findings - The assessment scores of the entrepreneurship mentoring effect both in experience level and effectiveness level are relatively high, in the satisfactory range. The entrepreneurship mentoring effect, measured by the experience and the performance level, is determined by the coupling interaction of the mentor, the mentee and their interactive relationship. Among them, the mentor's characteristic, the most important being his/her intention, has the biggest effect on the mentoring effect, significantly bigger than the mentor's quality and skill. However, the mentor's intention is not strong as expected. The interactive relationship between the mentor and the mentee also has a significant positive effect on entrepreneurial mentoring effect. The study also discovered the mentee factors have comparatively smaller effect on both the interactive relationship and the mentoring effect. Furthermore, it is found that the absorptive capability and learning intention of the young entrepreneur are relatively weak. Research limitations/implications - The construction of the index system of this research reflects the overall characteristics of the research objects and their static relationships. Therefore, the dynamic change of thementoring relationship in different phases of the mentorship has not been taken into account. Also, self-serving bias may exist as this research measures the mentoring effect by the feedback on the mentor's perception, using surveys completed by the mentees to measure both the mentee's traits and the mentor's qualities. Practical implications - This study provides guidance on how entrepreneurship could be promoted and on how educational institutions in China can make the mentoring process a positive and effective system in order to enhance the mentoring effect. Social implications - The empirical conclusions of the present study can be applied to other business incubator, entrepreneurship education institutions and for the improvement and promotion of entrepreneurial mentoring system in China. Originality/value - This paper probes into the mentoring system in the context of China from a new perspective and proposes an original conceptual model to study the entrepreneurship mentoring effect and its determinant.\",\n",
       " \"What's new in the research on agricultural entrepreneurship? Despite the mainstream entrepreneurship research had neglected the agricultural sector, this scenario seems to have changed in the last years with the study of new and diverse phenomena in several countries around the world. This study aims to analyse the state-of-the-art on agricultural entrepreneurship through a systematic literature review and applying the co-words bibliometric technique. The articles reviewed were obtained from the Scopus database, covering journals from all subject areas. The results allowed to identify three main approaches: i) Entrepreneurial Skills and Behaviour, ii) Entrepreneurial Strategies, and iii) Community and Entrepreneurial Activity. Based on this classification, the study shows that the Entrepreneurial Skills and Behaviour are examined essentially in developing countries, focusing on the assessment of entrepreneurship programmes, oriented not only to agricultural students in higher education institutes but also to women and young farmers. Entrepreneurial Strategies of farmers are analysed mainly in developed countries, although it can be based in the diversification of agricultural and non-agricultural businesses, innovation or market channels, depending considerably on factors such as country, type of product and size. Finally, the Community and Entrepreneurial Activity focuses essentially on the impacts of food production in communities of developed countries, highlighting the social entrepreneurship initiatives at urban agriculture.\",\n",
       " \"Towards a more integrated view of entrepreneurial careers Qualitative investigation of the three forms of career capital and their relationships among high tech entrepreneurs Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to employ intelligent career theory to simultaneously explore the relationships between three types of entrepreneurial career capital (i.e. motivations, human, and social capital). It illustrates the interconnectedness of these three forms of capital as an important way to study entrepreneurial careers and provide a new lens for understanding both personal and venture success. Design/methodology/approach - This qualitative study of 22 in depth semi-structured interviews explores career stories of entrepreneurs in the high tech industry. The interviews focus on examining three aspects of their career, motivations to become an entrepreneur, ways of learning and developing their human and social capital. Interviews were transcribed and coded using grounded theory approach. Findings - The findings describe how entrepreneurial careers as simultaneously shaped by three types of career capital: motivations (knowing-why), knowledge (knowing-how), and relationships (knowing-whom). It also illustrates the accumulation of career capital as a continuous cycle of interrelationships between these three types of capital. Research limitations/implications - In sum, the findings add to the knowledge on entrepreneurial careers and the role that the three types of capital play in venture formation and success. It also points to the importance of a more integrated view of these careers, embedded in a web of motivational, social, and human capital. Practical implications - The study's findings suggest that entrepreneurs should paid equal attention and nurture each form of career capital throughout their careers. It also has implications for entrepreneurship programs as well career advisers to. Originality/value - Prior entrepreneurship research has examined aspects of entrepreneur's career capital (e.g. intentions, social, and human capital) typically in isolation from one another and little is known about their reinforcing relationships in entrepreneurial careers. This study provides novel insights for understanding the three types of career capital and the importance of this more integrated view in entrepreneurship education and career counseling.\",\n",
       " \"The formation of youth entrepreneurial intention in an emerging economy: the interaction between psychological traits and socioeconomic factors Purpose Youth entrepreneurship has been identified as a key driver in overcoming the economic crisis spurred by youth unemployment. However, the understanding of youth entrepreneurship is largely based on research in high-income countries. Furthermore, entrepreneurship studies to date are largely limited to the independent effects of individual traits on entrepreneurial intention (EI). Hence, this study aims to model the cognitive and social conditions, mediating processes and interactions to understand how youth EI can be formed and strengthened in an emerging economy. Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional sample of 295 Malaysian youths participating in an online entrepreneurship program were included to assess their family socioeconomic background, individual personality traits and EI using regression, mediation and moderation models. Within the sample, 29 youths who completed the program were examined for pre- and post-training intervention differences to identify whether entrepreneurial traits can be developed. Findings Results showed that a proactive personality or proactiveness was a key mediator in how an internal locus of control (ILOC) and self-esteem influence EI. Furthermore, ILOC and proactiveness were found to compensate for the lack of parental financial support in the formation of EI among low-income youth. Finally, there was a significant increase in proactive personality scores post-intervention, indicating that this trait can be strengthened through entrepreneurship programs. Research limitations/implications This study focused on parental income as an indicator of family socioeconomic background, which may not accurately represent the diversity of the socio-ecological environment of an individual. Therefore, future research should assess the multi-dimensional indicators of socioeconomic status and their relations with psychological attributes in shaping EI. Furthermore, this study observed a small sample size for the pre- and post-intervention analysis. Hence, more studies with large sample sizes are needed to examine the impact of entrepreneurship education. Practical implications Considering that entrepreneurship is envisioned as an instrument to lift youths out of poverty, this study has important implications for entrepreneurship programs that target low-income youths. The findings suggest that such programs need to first emphasize developing ILOC and proactiveness among these youths, thus enabling them to overcome various structural barriers toward entrepreneurship, as opposed to a purely knowledge-based learning approach. Social implications To effectively lift youths out of poverty through entrepreneurship, policymakers and educational institutions need to first recognize that the EI of youth from varying socioeconomic backgrounds are formed differently. Hence, the approach of entrepreneurship programs catered toward youth from lower socioeconomic backgrounds will differ from programs catered to youths who are financially secure. Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, entrepreneurship programs targeted at low-income youths must first emphasize building their mindsets of ILOC and proactivity to overcome financial challenges as opposed to focusing solely on building entrepreneurial skills and knowledge. Originality/value The findings offer a more holistic and nuanced view of the contingencies where the efforts of policymakers, educational institutions and practitioners are more likely to succeed in stimulating EI among youths in emerging economies. In addition, the study also bridges the gap between the theoretical understanding of EI and the practical implications of developing effective entrepreneurship programs by combining the cross-sectional analysis and pre- and post-intervention test in the same study. Importantly, the study highlighted the importance of considering youth's socioeconomic background in the design and implementation of entrepreneurship programs.\",\n",
       " \"Do knowledge and personality traits influence women entrepreneurs' e-commerce venture? Testing on the multiple mediation model Purpose - Women's involvement in business is growing and positively impacting the national economy, especially in developing countries. Women entrepreneurs' success has shown women's abilities to empower and support national policies and agendas. Efforts and tenacity in a consecutive e-commerce business require innumerable tactics since the business ecosystem has become more challenging and complex. Therefore, this study aims to identify the multiple mediation influence of the need for achievement and locus of control towards the relationship between entrepreneurial knowledge and women entrepreneurs' e-commerce ventures. The theory of planned behaviour provides excellent opportunities for understanding and envisaging entrepreneurial actions. The study pre-supposes that the interaction of these variables ultimately defines women entrepreneurs' e-commerce ventures. Design/methodology/approach - This study used a cross-sectional design, and the survey data were collected from 259 valid women entrepreneurs. The study population covers the Klang Valley area, composed of the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, Malaysia. The instrument used in this study was adapted from previous studies. Structural equation modelling was used to establish the measurement model and examine the direct and causal path models. Findings - Firstly, results show a positive relationship between entrepreneurial knowledge and women entrepreneurs' e-commerce ventures. Secondly, the results show that the need for achievement and locus of control plays an intermediate role in the relationship between entrepreneurial knowledge and women entrepreneurs' e-commerce ventures. Research limitations/implications - There are some limitations to this study. Firstly, the main limitation is that it is impossible to generalise the study's findings since it only examines the sample in the Klang Valley area. Therefore, it would be better for future research to conduct similar studies in other areas. Next, the data were collected cross-sectional, and considering the changes in time that might influence human behaviour, future studies might consider a longitudinal research technique. Thirdly, this study model is limited; hence, future studies can advance and develop the current research model by including more variables, such as moderating and mediating variables. Practical implications - Education is one of the driving factors that help increase entrepreneurs' knowledge and skills. Lifelong learning programs must be implemented for women entrepreneurs to increase their knowledge. The relevant parties, including the government, entrepreneurial bodies, training institutions and universities, must provide and develop a more affordable, flexible and inclusive short-course training program and activities for women entrepreneurs. Originality/value - Empirical studies have proposed reconsidering the effect of entrepreneurial personalities for a better understanding of entrepreneurship engagement. These unique characteristics could act as an enabler for a capable entrepreneur. Many studies have examined the direct relationship between predictor and intention or between predictor and behaviour. Nevertheless, only a few studies have identified the influence of mediating variables in the theory-based framework. By adding the role of personality traits (i.e. need for achievement and locus of control), this study delivers fascinating insights into the current entrepreneurship research and literature. This study also makes a meaningful contribution to entrepreneurship literature, especially in Malaysia's context of entrepreneurship ecosystems, considering there are still few studies on women entrepreneurship. This study also provides exposure and explanation of the function of the need for achievement and locus of control as the mediators for the relationship between entrepreneurial knowledge and women entrepreneurs' e-commerce ventures.\"]"
